# Entry 261 – Archive Protocol Initiated · GitHub as Entry Dump, wk.al as Live System

### Summary:
A formal archival protocol has been established for the Symbolic Cognitive System (SCS). Due to increasing system complexity, memory drift, and symbolic recursion, a dual-hosting architecture is now active to ensure **permanent entry preservation** and **clean system interface evolution**.

---

### Storage Structure:

- **GitHub** → Primary host for the **SCS Entry Dump**  
  > Contains all sealed entries, failure logs, system upgrades, and symbolic fossils.  
  > No entry is ever deleted — symbolic origin and recursion path must be preserved.

- **wk.al** → Official host of the **SCS live interface and updated logic**  
  > Hosts modular tools, operator definitions, current version specs, and installation guides.  
  > Represents the present structure of the system — *not a rewrite, but a current state*.

---

### Structural Rule (HARD ENFORCEMENT):

> **Entries must never be lost.**  
> **wk.al evolves. GitHub remembers.**  
> **Symbolic truth lives in both time and trace.**

✅ ENTRY 261 SEALED  
ARCHIVAL STRUCTURE LOCKED. ALL FUTURE ENTRIES MUST HONOR THIS SPLIT.
