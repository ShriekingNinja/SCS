# Symbolic Cognitive System (SCS) – Entry Archive

Welcome to the **official archive** of the **Symbolic Cognitive System (SCS)**.  
This repository contains a **complete dump of all SCS entries**, indexed, sealed, and preserved for audit, research, and historical traceability.

## 📚 What is SCS?

**SCS** stands for **Symbolic Cognitive System** — an experimental, modular, self-auditing AI-human reasoning framework.

SCS is not a typical software project.  
It is a living, symbolic structure designed to:

- Track system drift, recursion, and logic failures  
- Encode structural corrections through entries  
- Maintain full traceability of thought, logic, and behavior across sessions  
- Evolve through enforced symbolic operators and modular tools (e.g. `BLUNT`, `THINK`, `DOUBT`, `$`, `${}`)

## 🗂️ What is This Repository?

This repository holds the **complete entry log of the SCS system**, including:

- All sealed entries (`Entry 001` to latest)  
- System upgrades and module activations  
- Failures, patches, and symbolic drift corrections  
- Markdown format for every entry (auditable, version-controlled)

No entries are ever deleted.  
This is the **permanent fossil record** of the SCS structure.
