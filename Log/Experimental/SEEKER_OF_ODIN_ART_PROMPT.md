**ART PROMPT — General Creation (Visual Still / Generative Variant)**  

**Scene Concept:**  
A hooded, masked dark-side acolyte in a frozen twilight battlefield. The figure stands mid-motion, cloak sweeping through cold wind and snow mist. Their armor and helmet bear intricate **Shanenawá-inspired linework** (non-sacred motifs), **small etched runes** (ᛒ, ᛟ) symbolizing the Seeker-of-Odin, and **Berkano vine filigree** glowing faintly in **Aqua #30FED7**.  

**Mood & Lighting:**  
Blue-gray dusk atmosphere under a faint aurora. Light snowfall descends; cyan rimlight defines the silhouette; warm glints trace the worn metal edges. A subtle fog and low grain evoke cinematic coldness and introspection.  

**Composition:**  
- **Foreground:** The acolyte framed in a dynamic diagonal stance, saber ignited in crimson arcs.  
- **Midground:** Blurred snow plume lifting from the impact.  
- **Background:** Open icy plain fading to horizon, aurora streaks overhead.  
- **Camera angle:** Slight low-tilt, cinematic perspective; wind sweeping cloak and particles.  

**Color & Grade:**  
Dominant cool tones (steel blue, gray, cyan) with controlled warmth in reflections. Use desaturated midtones and soft highlights to maintain balance between mysticism and realism.  

**Symbolic Details:**  
- Runes ᛒ and ᛟ etched subtly along helmet rim.  
- Linework reflects harmony between technology and spirit, respecting Shanenawá cultural geometry.  
- Filigree veins glow faintly, signifying the Berkano link — structure, growth, and stewardship.  

**Atmosphere:**  
Serenity amid motion — the silence before a duel. Capture *stewardship over spectacle* in tone.  

**Negative Prompt:**  
Exclude franchise marks, sacred or religious symbols, visible human faces, gore, hate iconography, or any watermark artifacts.  

**Style Reference:**  
Cinematic realism blended with mythic tone; suitable for fine-art illustration, generative diffusion, or frame-concept design.
