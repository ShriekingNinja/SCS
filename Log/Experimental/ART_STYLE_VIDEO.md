TEXT-TO-VIDEO PROMPT — “Recursive Minimalism with Silent Contradiction” (9:16, 12–15s)

Format
- Duration: 12–15 seconds
- Resolution: 1080×1920 (vertical)
- Framerate: 24 fps
- Render style: 2D flat-shaded vector look; crisp anti-aliased edges; no textures; no photorealism

Art Direction (carryover from master prompt)
- Structural surrealism via minimalist, architectural logic
- Precise geometric forms, soft pastel gradients, silent spatial tension
- Feels like a visual audit: calm, exact, and subtly wrong
- No storytelling cues; no emotion

Composition Constraints
- Flat planes, orthogonal geometry, stable alignments
- 1–2 focal elements only (e.g., column, platform, bridge, tree, solitary placeholder figure)
- Central symmetry, balanced visual weight, ample negative space
- Each element = structural logic unit (no decorative metaphor)
- If a figure is used: silhouette/placeholder only; no face/gender/emotion/action

Palette & Light
- Pastel, rational palette: powder blue, ash gray, warm off-white, pre-dawn pink
- Shadows obey geometry (no dramatic or narrative lighting)
- Background: smooth vertical gradient; no celestial symbols, no clouds, no depth simulation

Silent Contradiction (core)
- Include exactly one paradox that reveals between 8–12s:
  Options (pick one):
  1) A rectangular pillar casts a **perfect circular shadow** that remains precise as the camera moves
  2) A bridge’s **reflection shows a different object** in a still, flat “water strip”
  3) A flat shape **folds into itself** in an impossible way while edges stay planar
- The paradox is non-whimsical, non-magical, non-verbal; it produces structural dissonance
- No additional effects; keep it quiet and precise

Motion Plan / Shot List
1) 0–4s — Establish: locked or ultra-slow dolly toward the central geometry; still air; no particles
2) 4–8s — Hold with micro-parallax (subtle camera drift) to emphasize orthogonals and negative space
3) 8–12s — Reveal the single paradox (shadow/reflection/fold) without changing lighting or adding drama
4) 12–15s — Hold on the resolved frame for audit clarity; clean cut to black

Prohibited (hard)
- No 3D renders or texture maps
- No photorealism, painterly strokes, film grain, glow, bloom, or noise
- No faces, fashion, emotional poses
- No animals (unless motionless symbolic shape)
- No dynamic lighting, flares, or narrative props
- No cultural symbols, logos, or text overlays

Audio
- Silent OR ultra-low neutral room tone; no melody, no drums, no risers

Negative Prompt
- No 3D, no photoreal, no texture, no noise, no glow, no film grain, no text, no logos, no characters with faces, no dramatic light, no particles, no depth-of-field blur
