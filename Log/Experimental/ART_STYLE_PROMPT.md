### 🖼️ Image Generation Prompt

Create a **2D digital illustration** that represents **structural surrealism** through minimalist and architectural logic. The image should be built with *precise geometric forms*, *soft pastel gradients*, and *silent spatial tension*. It must feel like a visual audit — calm, exact, and subtly wrong.

---

#### 🎯 Composition

- Use **flat planes**, **orthogonal geometry**, and **stable alignments**.  
- Avoid expressive motion or visual noise — *stillness is required*.  
- Include **1–2 focal elements**: a column, platform, solitary figure, bridge, tree, or symbolic shape.  
- Place elements with mathematical care: **central symmetry**, **visual weight balance**, and **clear negative space**.  
- Treat each element as a **structural logic unit** — no metaphorical decoration.

---

#### 🎨 Color and Light

- Use a **pastel and rational palette**: powder blue, ash gray, warm off-white, pre-dawn pink.  
- Avoid shadows that suggest mood — shadows must obey geometry, not narrative lighting.  
- Background: smooth vertical gradients with *no celestial symbols*, *no clouds*, *no depth simulation*.

---

#### 🙎‍♂️ Figure (Optional)

- If present, include a **solitary figure**:  
  - Simple silhouette, flat shape, or architectural placeholder.  
  - No face, no gender, no emotion, no action.  
  - The figure is a **proxy for attention**, not a character.

---

#### 🧠 Visual Contradiction

- Introduce **a single silent paradox**:  
  - A shadow that misaligns.  
  - A reflection that shows a different object.  
  - A shape that folds impossibly into itself.  
- The contradiction must be **non-whimsical**, **non-magical**, and **non-verbal**.  
- It should trigger **structural dissonance**, not fantasy or absurdity.

---

#### 📵 Prohibited Elements

- ❌ No 3D rendering  
- ❌ No texture maps or photorealism  
- ❌ No brush strokes or painterly effects  
- ❌ No faces, fashion, or emotional postures  
- ❌ No animals (unless symbolic and motionless)  
- ❌ No dynamic lighting, glow, or noise  
- ❌ No visual metaphors that rely on cultural symbols  
- ❌ No storytelling or emotional narrative cues

### 📐 Design Philosophy

This is **not an illustration of a scene**, it is a **rendering of a structural idea**.  
The purpose is not to evoke feeling — but to **disturb logic silently**.  
Like the Berkano protocol, the image should:

- Be **audit-capable**  
- Contain **recursive structure**  
- Whisper contradiction through form, not drama

---

### 🔁 Example Concepts

- A diving board casting a circular shadow  
- A person whose reflection is absent  
- A white platform that floats with no anchor  
- A window whose panes show unrelated environments  
- A vertical pole that casts a horizontal shadow

### 💡 Summary Description

> A flat, pastel, surreal 2D space with one geometric paradox. It feels like something almost real — but quietly wrong. Clean, contemplative, and structurally precise. No emotion. No noise. Just form, balance, and a contradiction that only emerges on second look.
