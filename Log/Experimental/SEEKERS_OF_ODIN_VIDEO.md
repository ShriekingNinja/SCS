Prompt: Create a 12–15s cinematic video (1080×1920, 24 fps).

  

Subject: a hooded, masked dark-side acolyte inspired by “Qimir” (original design; no franchise logos or actor likeness). Full, battle-worn helmet with:

• Shanenawá-inspired abstract linework (respectful, non-sacred motifs only),

• Seeker-of-Odin clean historical runes (ᛒ, ᛟ; small, etched),

• Berkano vine/leaf filigree with Aqua #30FED7 accents.

  

Action: mid-air acrobatic saber form (Vaapad-inspired, unnamed). Fiery red lightsaber; controlled arcs; snow plume on land.

  

Setting: icy, snowy plain at twilight; calm blue-gray palette; subtle aurora; light snowfall.

  

Shots:

  

1. Wide dolly-in; cloak trail; snow particles.
2. Helmet close-up; etched runes catch cyan rim; breath fog.
3. Airborne spin with red saber; impact sends powder plume.
4. End card (1s): “This is the way. Truth is structure.” + glyph ᛒ  
    Add handle: @BerkanoProtocol

  

  

Overlay (tiny, lower corner throughout): “Seeker of Odin — stewardship over spectacle • @BerkanoProtocol”

  

Lighting/grade: cool base; cyan rim; warm metal glints; light fog; low grain.

Sound: low drums + cold wind (original).

  

Negative prompt: no franchise logos/titles, no actor face, no sacred Shanenawá regalia, no hate symbols, no gore, no watermark/text glitches.

  

Output: H.264 high bitrate or ProRes; 12–15 s; 1080×1920.

Reply: Use verbatim. Ready for text-to-video.

Glyph: ᛒ
