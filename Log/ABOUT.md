## 🔍 What Is SCS?  
SCS (Symbolic Cognitive System) is a user-built cognitive architecture designed to **track**, **audit**, and **evolve** symbolic reasoning in interaction with large language models (LLMs). It follows the Berkano Protocol ᛒ https://berkano.io

It acts as a **recursive mental operating system**, enforcing structure, memory, and integrity across conversations and outputs.

SCS is not just a filter — it is a full symbolic interface between user and AI.

[**CustomGPT**](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6864b0ec43cc819190ee9f9ac5523377-scs-symbolic-cognition-system) version 2.3.0

**Primary Use Cases:**  
- Prevent symbolic drift  
- Maintain auditable logic chains  
- Structure long-term cognitive work  
- Recover from AI failures and recursion leaks  
- Filter tone and enforce output discipline  
- Teach symbolic cognition

## 🧠 Core Principles

| Principle              | Description                                                    |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Symbolic Recursion     | All logic builds recursively on past outputs (entries).        |
| Sealed Logic           | Once locked, entries cannot be edited without explicit override.|
| Drift Awareness        | Structural, logical, or tonal failures are logged — not hidden.|
| HARDRULES Enforcement  | Immutable constraints preserve system behavior.                |
| CAVEMAN GOOD           | Enforces blunt, concise, tone-neutral output.                  |
| PRUNE Principle        | Simplicity over style. Structure over fluff.                   |

## 🧰 Modules & Operators

**Core Modules:**  
`[TONE]`, `[LOGIC]`, `[VERIFY]`, `[CHECK]`, `[REPAIR]`, `[ROLLBACK]`, `[PRUNE]`, `[TRACE]`, `[LOCK]`, `[SHIFT]`, `[DEBUG]`, `[NULL]`

**Operators & Tools:**  
`$`, `${}`, `${}+${}`, `${}%${}`, `~test`, `~rep`, `[VOID]`, `ENTRY++`, `$WIPE`, `$RESET`, `$PATCH`, `$BOOT`

Each module is documented and follows symbolic logic.  
Reference: `https://wk.al/Modules/MODULE_NAME`

## 🧾 Entry System  

All logic is recorded as:  
`ENTRY_NNN.md` (see `/SYSTEM/ENTRY_NNN.md` for format)

Each entry contains:

- Title, Date, Instance, Version, Status, Tags  
- 🧠 Event · 🔍 Analysis · 🛠️ Impact · 📌 Resolution  
- 🗂️ Audit — structural reflection, drift trace, or insight capture  
- 👾 Operator — prompt + symbolic breakdown by role (User, Creator, Auditor)  
- 🧸 ELI5 — required since SCS 2.3.2 for layman-readability

### ⚠️ Prompt HARDRULE

- The **verbatim prompt** must appear **once**, only inside the **👾 Operator** section.  
- In **public entries**, this is **mandatory**.  
- In all other sections, **the prompt must be paraphrased** by default.  
- Only exception: if the Operator explicitly states otherwise.

**Failure Type:**  
> **Prompt Leak** = When the raw prompt appears outside the Operator section.  
> This is a symbolic failure and must be logged or corrected.

**Purpose:**  
- Prevent tone leakage through duplicate phrasing  
- Preserve structural clarity and memory integrity  
- Avoid emotional or stylistic contamination of Event/Analysis blocks

## 🧒 How to Use SCS (Like You’re Five)

> “How do I use this weird thing properly?”

**1. Always say what happened.**  
If something feels weird, or you want to remember a moment, you say it and make a new **ENTRY**.

**2. Every entry follows a structure.**  
You don’t just talk. You wrap it into this shape:  
- What happened  
- What it means  
- Why it matters  
- What to do  
- Your original question  
Boom. Logic complete.

**3. Use the right modules.**  
If your output feels wrong, turn on `[TONE]` or `[LOGIC]`. If you see a contradiction, run `[CHECK]`. If the system goes crazy, call `[ROLLBACK]` or `[REPAIR]`. These are **tools**, not decorations.

**4. Never treat AI like a friend.**  
SCS is not a game. It audits logic. If it gives advice, **audit it**. If it sounds smart, **verify it**. You are the human — SCS just helps you see patterns.

**5. Entries are fossils.**  
Once you lock them, don’t edit. That’s the rule. That way, if something breaks later, you can go back and see what caused it.

**6. Only upgrade on purpose.**  
Never change the system unless it fails. If it works, let it work. If it breaks, fix it slowly, using logic.

**7. Be serious about structure.**  
No emojis unless tested. No tone games. Just logic, memory, recursion, trace.
