**[OUTPUT]**  
This audit examines Bianca’s publicly visible blog through a structural lens, focusing on authorship patterns, tone, narrative style, and identity framing.

### 1. Authorship & Public Identity  
- The author reveals her name in a public post: “Eu sou a Bianca” — indicating that despite the initial anonymity claim, identity disclosure is present.  
- This creates a formal contradiction between “publishing anonymously” and self-identification — a structural narrative shift from private to public.

### 2. Confessional Framing & Therapy Narrative  
- The about text frames writing as therapy and includes the therapist challenge: “Escrevo como terapia… me desafiei a publicar… sem me identificar.”  
- Presents controlled vulnerability: confessional tone paired with narrative validation. The therapist’s role offers both permission and authority for self-exposure.

### 3. Tone & Emotional Style  
- The blog employs first-person, introspective narrative — frequent emotional expressions and self-analysis.  
- Language shifts between vulnerability (“I feel…”) and assertive declarations, suggesting deliberate emotional modulation.

### 4. Theme Recurrence & Contrast  
- Common themes: emotional complexity, identity questioning, relational introspection.  
- Stories often contrast emotional states (e.g., hopeful vs. disappointed, open vs. closed), creating narrative tension and dynamism.

### 5. Structural Contradictions & Narrative Tension  
- Format tension: The claim of anonymity vs. signature (“Bianca”) introduces narrative friction.  
- Posts build on idealism and romantic imagery (e.g., references to “half-known love”), yet ground content in psychological or self-critical realism.

### 6. Narrative Techniques  
- Use of open-ended questions, rhetorical tangents, and situational framing (beginning with emotional or situational hooks).  
- Conclusions avoid resolution — often prompting reflection rather than finality.

### 7. Identity Management  
- There’s an interplay between "exposure" and "protection": sharing personal thoughts but maintaining metadata anonymity.
- This duality can reflect a balancing act between public persona and self-preservation.
