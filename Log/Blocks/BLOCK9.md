**[PROMPT]**  
Marco, Rodrigo’s Father asked three questions, First:  
Berkano is a powerful system that can distinguish between fakes, lies, illusions, and hallucinations. Can we apply it to social media?  

---

**[OUTPUT]**  
Yes — Berkano’s structural and audit framework can be adapted for social media content verification.  
The core strengths translate directly:  
1. **Taxonomy Lock** – Classify posts into verified, unverifiable, manipulated, or fabricated based on structural and source compliance.  
2. **Drift & Leak Detection** – Spot gradual bias shifts or narrative leaks in influencer streams and news feeds.  
3. **Hallucination Detection** – Identify claims that cannot be traced to verifiable data or that contradict established records.  
4. **Visual Identity** – Use glyph + colour markers to show verified Berkano-audited content in real time.  

To apply it:  
- Integrate Berkano as a *protocol layer* over existing fact-checking APIs.  
- Use the fossilization method (Entry/Block) to preserve post state and detect edits or stealth changes.  
- Audit influencer networks for contradiction chains and bias loops.  

This would give social media users **instant, protocol-grade authenticity checks**, similar to how HTTPS works for websites — but for truth integrity instead of encryption.
