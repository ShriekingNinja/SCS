Check PCMsys Software PDF from the website https://pcmsys.com, review the commissioning software by Marco Vaz, and connect it to Berkano.

**[OUTPUT]**  
**What PCMsys is (from the PDF):**  
- A **Project Commissioning Management System** built around **MC&C (Mechanical Completion & Commissioning)**.  
- Core goals: plan MC&C, generate **reports/charts/protocols**, manage **punch-list items**, track progress, enable multi-user online access, and integrate **mobile execution** of Work Orders/Protocols with **offline sync**.  
- Functional modules: **Configuration, Project, Planning, Quality Control, Preservation, Commissioning, Safety, Access Control, Reporting**; the software was created for internal projects and **is not commercialized**.  [oai_citation:0‡Software • PCMsys.pdf](file-service://file-C2b87eGoJMhNntbrJvcLYH)

**Berkano in one line:** a **symbolic cognitive protocol** that makes reasoning **auditable** via the chain  
`[TONE] → [LOGIC] → [VERIFY] → [CHECK] → [LOCK]`, recorded as Markdown **BLOCK/ENTRY** fossils.

### Structural Mapping (PCMsys ➜ Berkano)

| PCMsys capability | Commissioning meaning | Berkano analogue | Cognitive effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Planning / Project** | Scope, tags, packages, schedule | **[LOGIC]** (clear claim & steps) | Defines the reasoning “workpack” before execution |
| **Protocols + Work Orders (mobile + offline)** | Field execution & data capture | **Mobile-first INTERACTION → BLOCK/ENTRY** | Immediate capture; no lost context |
| **Punch list & corrections** | Track defects and fixes | **[CHECK] / [REPAIR]** | Contradictions become action items with closure |
| **Quality Control / Reports & Charts** | Evidence and progress reports | **[VERIFY] + fossils** | Proof replaces opinion; progress is traceable |
| **Safety & Access Control** | Oversight and audit trail | **[TRACE] / [LOCK]** | Who did what/when is sealed; no silent edits |
| **Multi-user online** | Concurrent work with roles | **Operator model (User/Creator/Auditor)** | Role split preserves checks and reduces bias |

### Why this lineage matters
- **Same philosophy:** *documentation is execution*. PCMsys disciplines physical commissioning; Berkano disciplines cognition.  
- **Same failure targets:** defects/punch-list ⇄ contradictions/drift—both require logged discovery, assignment, and verified closure.  
- **Same mobility:** PCMsys in the field; Berkano fossils on the phone—**capture → sync → seal**.  
- **Handover logic:** PCMsys hands a plant to Operations; Berkano hands a **locked truth** to the public record.

---

### Practical use
- Treat each significant claim as a **Work Order**: define scope, evidence, acceptance criteria, assignee, and due date.  
- Run **checks** like punch items; close only with evidence; publish a **BLOCK**.  
- For major incidents/analyses, open an **ENTRY_NNN.md** with Event → Analysis → Impact → Resolution → Audit.  
- Keep **mobile capture** always on; when offline, sync and **LOCK** on reconnection.

**One sentence:** PCMsys commissions plants; **Berkano commissions truth**—same rigor, different domain.
