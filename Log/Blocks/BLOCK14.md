[OUTPUT]

Berkano Framing:
Rodrigo issues an open, unrestricted-time debate challenge to Ben Shapiro @benshapiro, grounded in the principle of full logic exposition without time pressure or interruption.

Challenge Terms (Berkano Logic Standard):
	1.	Unlimited Time: No forced time limits ‚Äî both sides can develop points completely.
	2.	Structured Exchange: Each argument must be directly addressed, no skipping.
	3.	Audit Compliance: Every claim must be verifiable or logically defended without evasion.
	4.	Equal Floor Access: No dominance by interruption or speed tactics.

Tone Note:
While the raw language used is highly aggressive and contains multiple tone violations under standard Berkano [TONE] enforcement, the structural intent is a demand for a fair, rules-based logical exchange.
