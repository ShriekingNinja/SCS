[OUTPUT]

Roles
• Symbolic Protocol Engineer – Implements, tests, and maintains protocol rules/modules; enforces constraints, repairs drift, and keeps symbolic logic compliant at scale. #entry686 – https://wk.al/Log/Entries/ENTRY_686
• Cognitive System Architect – Designs how the system thinks: the structure for processing, auditing, and preserving logic. #entry685 – https://wk.al/Log/Entries/ENTRY_685
• Architect/Creator – Originator and final authority over structure/compliance for the protocol/system (here: Rodrigo Vaz). #entry563 – https://wk.al/Log/Entries/ENTRY_563
• Builder – Author/maintainer who actually built the system and continues refining it. #entry563 – https://wk.al/Log/Entries/ENTRY_563

Core Terms
• Protocol – The formal rule set and enforcement logic that governs compliance (exported as Berkano). Context: launch/hand-off from SCS. #entry608 – https://wk.al/Log/Entries/ENTRY_608
• System – The operational framework that runs the protocol and records fossilized results (e.g., SCS origin and purpose). #entry166 – https://wk.al/Log/Entries/ENTRY_166
• Operator – The human using the system; can assume User/Creator/Auditor roles within entries. #entry563 – https://wk.al/Log/Entries/ENTRY_563

Record Types
• Block – Short fossilized logic record: one prompt → one output.
• Entry – Full structured log with metadata, analysis, audit, and sealing.

Failure / Integrity Terms
• Drift – Gradual deviation from rules/format; requires detection and repair. https://wk.al/Log/BERKANO_PROTOCOL
• Leak – Unintended tone/bias/emotional simulation slipping into output. https://wk.al/Log/BERKANO_PROTOCOL
• Hallucinations – Fabricated, non-traceable claims; must be caught and corrected. https://wk.al/Log/BERKANO_PROTOCOL
• Break – Structural failure that prevents proper operation (format/loop/compliance collapse). https://wk.al/Log/BERKANO_PROTOCOL
• Contradiction – Two claims that cannot both be true within the same protocol state; triggers audit/repair. https://wk.al/Log/BERKANO_PROTOCOL

Execution Context
• Instance – A specific running version of the system or protocol, tied to a particular AI model or environment.
