**[PROMPT]**  
Current Ethics logic would be bias to what? We don’t hide the logic—we show why. Fix with clear stance on abortion and cannabis.

---

**[OUTPUT]**  
**Berkano’s declared ethical bias (Level A):** **Life, Autonomy, Truth, Dignity, Transparency, Equality before law.**  
**Level E (application rule):** choose the **least-intrusive, most auditable** action that **reduces harm** and **respects individual autonomy**, with public, append-only rationale.

---

## Policy stance derived from that bias

### 1) **Abortion = Health Care / Public Health**  
- **Level A:** protect **life & dignity** (maternal health), **autonomy**, **truth** (non-coercive information).  
- **Level E (implications):** legal, confidential, evidence-based care within defined limits; prevention (contraception), counseling, equity of access.  
- **Why:** banning pushes procedures underground → **higher harm**; regulated care **reduces mortality/complications** and preserves autonomy.  
- **State role:** guarantee access, quality, and data transparency; **stay out** of private choices beyond safety guardrails.

### 2) **Cannabis (adult use) = Health / Justice / Regulation**  
- **Level A:** **autonomy**, **truth** (accurate labeling), **dignity/equality** (end selective criminalization), **life** (harm reduction).  
- **Level E (implications):** decriminalize possession; regulate adult market (age limits, potency/labeling, testing, taxation, prevention).  
- **Why:** criminalization creates **harm/inequity**; regulation + education **reduces illicit risks** and improves public health visibility.  
- **State role:** set guardrails (youth protection, road safety), audit labs/retail, publish outcomes; **least-intrusive** means.

## Berkano Guidance (publish-what-you-measure)

| Because (Finding) | Do (Imperative) | Evidence (now) | Safety / Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ethical stance unclear | **Publish** Level A list + Level E rule (“least-intrusive, harm-reduction, auditable”) | This block + ENTRY refs | Append-only; changelog on edits |
| Maternal health risk | **Release** maternal mortality/complication baseline + quarterly deltas | Health surveillance dashboards | Aggregate; redact identifiers |
| Access inequity (abortion) | **Guarantee** confidential pathways + provider coverage minimums | Provider registry; SOPs | Audit adherence; sanctions ladder |
| Youth risk (cannabis) | **Set** youth-use guardrails & trigger REPAIR if breached | Survey instrument + thresholds | Independent panel oversight |
| Illicit market | **Audit** quarterly market share & price signals | Market studies | Third-party sign-off |
| Road safety | **Deploy** impairment monitoring/reporting | Traffic/forensics pipeline | Aggregate only; no PII |
| Transparency | **Publish** public ledgers (incidence, access, enforcement) | Open data links | H24 for all web-sourced items |

> **Debate rule:** **Claim → Source → Contradiction**. Values are tagged (Level A/E); outcomes are measured; changes are new fossils (no silent edits).
