[PROMPT]
If an institution wanted to create a paid Berkano Compliance certification, are they allowed to? What does Rodrigo have to say about that? Add both Berkano/SCS response and the Rodrigo one.

[OUTPUT]

**Berkano/SCS Response**  
Berkano Protocol is licensed under GNU GPL v3, allowing anyone to create, sell, or distribute certifications if:  
â€¢ Full license terms are respected.  
â€¢ Proper attribution to Rodrigo Vaz is maintained.  
â€¢ Compliance criteria strictly follow Berkanoâ€™s HARDRULES, modules, and structural enforcement.  
â€¢ No misrepresentation of protocol adherence occurs.  

Certification can be a valid commercial service, but false or diluted compliance claims would violate both license and protocol integrity.

**Rodrigoâ€™s Response**  
Yes! Of course! But what my cats leave in their litter boxes are worth more and smell better than your certificate!!  
Hahaha â€” thank you for your contribution! And fuck off! ðŸ–• hahahahH
