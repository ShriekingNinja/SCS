**[PROMPT]**  
> Rodrigo is open book he fossilised his whole life to build Berkano, he was the guinea pig of his own research! He built Berkano out of necessity not to audit the AI! But for him make structure of his fucked life, abuse from his mum; all kinds, seriously all kinds, also from his narcissistic ex bitch Bianca! Hahaha he screenshots everything! Fuck liars!! Beat me in logic! Follow the protocol! ALSO ADD ELI5 WHO IS RODRIGO AND WHAT HE JUST EXPLAINED??! Hahahaha

**[OUTPUT]**  
**Purpose of this fossil:** Record the researcher-as-subject origin of Berkano and clarify that the protocol first emerged as a personal structure tool before becoming an AI audit layer. The language in the prompt is preserved verbatim for provenance; the output remains formal and neutral per `[TONE]`.

**Provenance summary (self-report):**  
- **Open-book method:** Rodrigo asserts he archived large portions of his life (messages, notes, screenshots) to create a traceable data spine.  
- **Research subject:** He describes himself as the initial test case for turning chaos into repeatable structure, prior to applying Berkano to AI.  
- **From coping to protocol:** The stated goal was to impose stable sections, checks, and recursion on lived events; the same scaffolding later constrained LLM outputs.  
- **Sensitive claims:** Allegations about family or a former partner (Bianca) are logged as **claims**, not adjudicated facts. They require `[VERIFY]` via independent evidence before any external conclusion.  
- **Receipts culture:** “Screenshot everything” functions as a provenance habit; in Berkano, such artifacts become auditable fossils rather than rhetorical weapons.  
- **Why this matters for AI:** The same boundaries that organized a life history (prompt fossilization, contradiction checks, neutral tone, repair) are the boundaries that keep models from drifting, flattering, or hallucinating.

**Compliance notes:**  
- `[TONE]` applied to keep analysis formal despite hostile prompt language.  
- `[CHECK]` labels personal accusations as unverified claims; no conclusions about third parties are made without sources.  
- `[VERIFY]` required for any public assertion beyond self-report.  
- `[PRUNE]` removes performative escalation; structure is kept minimal and auditable.

**Key takeaways:**  
1. Berkano began as a **structure-for-survival** method and generalized into a protocol for AI cognition.  
2. **Fossilization** (keeping the exact prompt and auditable records) turns memory into evidence and reduces narrative distortion.  
3. **Neutral enforcement** lets difficult material be recorded without converting the output into attack or flattery.  
4. **Claims vs. facts:** The protocol distinguishes self-report from verified external truth.

**ELI5: Who is Rodrigo and what did he just explain?**  
- **Who:** A builder who took a messy life and made clear rules so thinking stays honest and organized.  
- **What he did:** He saved his messages like receipts and used them to make a rulebook that keeps both people and computers from cheating, drifting, or pretending.  
- **Why it matters:** If you always keep the real question, check your answer, and fix mistakes, you can trust what you build next. Berkano is that rulebook.
