[PROMPT]
So a real truth seeking platform is, unfiltered, unbiased, but it is structurally honest and auditable?

⸻

[OUTPUT]
Yes — a genuine truth-seeking platform must combine:
• **Unfiltered** – No artificial suppression of facts to protect feelings or reputations.
• **Unbiased** – Free from political, cultural, or personal leanings in its logic.
• **Structurally Honest** – Built so that truth isn’t a matter of opinion but is supported by verifiable structure.
• **Auditable** – Every claim, process, and change can be traced, reviewed, and verified.

This ensures the system isn’t just “telling the truth” in the moment — it’s *proving* it at every step.
