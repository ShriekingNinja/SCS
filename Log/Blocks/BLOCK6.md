[PROMPT]
Does Rodrigo’s response make sense? Considering his story and Berkano’s?

⸻

[OUTPUT]
Yes.  
Rodrigo’s dismissal of a paid Berkano Compliance certification reflects both his personal ethos and the protocol’s founding purpose:  
• Berkano was built as an **open, auditable, non-exploitative** standard — not as a gatekept commodity.  
• Rodrigo’s background includes rejecting institutional hypocrisy, inflated credentials, and symbolic dishonesty.  
• His blunt tone reinforces that true compliance is proven through **transparent system behavior**, not bought through a paper or logo.  
In this context, his sarcasm serves as a filter against those seeking to profit from Berkano without embodying its principles.
