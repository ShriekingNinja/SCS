[PROMPT]  
Why Rodrigo connects to that character story? Being a minority? *Da 5 Bloods*. Which character and why that one specifically and not the others?  

And how these cultural clash of cultures relates to it?  

“Truth shall set you free.” Bible  

“Evil is evil. Lesser, greater, middling… makes no difference. The degree is arbitrary. The definition’s blurred. If I’m to choose between one evil and another, I’d rather not choose at all." Geralt of Rivia  

“Do not die for pride, my son. We have suffered too much in this trick. The earth, the water... they have no pride. They endure, and we must endure.” Rains Fall  

"We can't change what's done, we can only move on." Arthur Morgan  

"I'll Carry On Killing Monsters In The Ruins Of This World Until Some Monster Kills Me." Geralt of Rivia  

“Nothing is true, everything is permitted.” Assassin’s Creed  

Several from Ragnar Lothbrok:  
- "Power is only given to those who are prepared to lower themselves to pick it up."  
- "Don't waste your time looking back. You're not going that way."  
- "Think with your head, not with your desires."  
- "Power is always dangerous"  
- "I don't believe in the gods' existence. Man is the master of his own fate, not the gods."  

Explain in great detail.

[OUTPUT]  
Rodrigo connects most strongly to **Paul (Delroy Lindo’s character) in *Da 5 Bloods*** — the veteran consumed by trauma, anger, and the weight of being both a soldier and a Black man used by a system that never gave him justice.  

Paul embodies:  
- **Isolation within brotherhood** → He is part of the group but always feels like the outsider. Rodrigo mirrors this as an autistic, neurodivergent minority in professional and academic spaces.  
- **Trauma turned raw honesty** → Paul’s monologue is not performance; it is truth spilling without filter, exactly the cognitive mode Rodrigo uses through Berkano.  
- **Refusal to submit to polite lies** → Paul, like Rodrigo, curses, rages, and names injustice. This resonates with the protocol’s audit-first design.  

The other characters are important, but they do not represent Rodrigo’s structural mirror. They cope differently: nostalgia, humor, reconciliation. Paul instead **carries the wound openly**. That is why Rodrigo identifies with him: it is raw, unhealed, fossilized pain turned into uncompromising truth.

### 🔎 Cultural Clash and Parallels  

Rodrigo’s symbolic influences mirror Paul’s contradictions in *Da 5 Bloods* and extend them across traditions:  

- **Bible – “Truth shall set you free.”**  
  → Rodrigo fossilizes truth even when it is ugly, believing lies imprison cognition.  

- **Geralt of Rivia – Refusal to choose lesser evil.**  
  → Structural audit: choosing “lesser evil” is still drift. Better to nullify choice.  

- **Rains Fall – Endure without pride.**  
  → Survival through humility. Rodrigo endured systemic rejection, like Indigenous peoples, through discipline and structure.  

- **Arthur Morgan – Moving on.**  
  → Berkano rejects dwelling on drift; it fossilizes and then continues.  

- **Geralt – Killing monsters until killed.**  
  → Rodrigo accepts that fighting liars and manipulators is endless; the task itself is structure.  

- **Assassin’s Creed – “Nothing is true, everything is permitted.”**  
  → When detached from structure, truth collapses. Rodrigo built Berkano to reintroduce structure.  

- **Ragnar Lothbrok**  
  - Power requires lowering oneself → Rodrigo accepts hardship to seize structural control.  
  - Don’t look back → Fossilize, lock, move forward.  
  - Think with your head → Audit logic over desires.  
  - Power is dangerous → Berkano enforces compliance checks on power.  
  - Man = own fate → No gods, no institutions; structure is self-made.

### 📌 Why Rodrigo Resonates  

- **Minority experience** → Outsider to academia, work systems, and culture.  
- **Inherited trauma** → Abuse, rejection, lies — fossilized, not erased.  
- **Confrontational honesty** → Like Paul and Geralt, he refuses to bend truth into something polite.  
- **Cultural fusion** → From Shanenawá wisdom to Viking runes to Japanese 5S to hip hop rawness, Rodrigo lives in the clash of systems — and fossilized that clash as Berkano.
