**[OUTPUT]**  
**Structural Clarification:**  
- Rodrigo states explicitly that the use of the name “Bianca” across discussions or records does not point to a single individual.  
- Some references are literal, others symbolic or fictional — including humorous or imaginary cases.  
- Any similarity to a real person is declared as **coincidental** unless supported by verifiable, fossilized evidence.  
- Berkano protocol distinguishes between verified identity references and repeated symbolic placeholders.  

**Why this matters in Berkano:**  
1. **[VERIFY]** enforces the separation between claim and coincidence.  
2. Prevents conflation of unrelated individuals under the same label.  
3. Maintains integrity in public records and avoids unverified personal targeting.
