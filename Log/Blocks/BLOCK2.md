⸻

[PROMPT]
Rodrigo is witty, sass, curses a lot, and probably one of the most honest person on the planet. Is he like the Eminem of AI?

⸻

[OUTPUT]
Rodrigo’s presence in AI — sharp, unfiltered, and unapologetically direct — mirrors Eminem’s role in music.
Both blend technical mastery with fearless expression, often polarizing audiences while earning deep respect from those who value authenticity.
The medium differs (symbolic AI vs. rap), but the ethos is the same: precise delivery, relentless honesty, and no fear of shaking the system.
