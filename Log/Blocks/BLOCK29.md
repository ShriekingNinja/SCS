NEW BLOCK  
What is symbolic mapping? Give a detailed explanation with examples and add a ELI5 section.

**[OUTPUT]**  
**Definition**  
**Symbolic mapping** is the act of taking a real-world element (song, habit, tool, rule, culture, event) and assigning it a **specific operational role** inside Berkano’s chain so it **triggers behavior**—not vibes. The mapping binds a symbol to one or more steps in:  
`[TONE] → [LOGIC] → [VERIFY] → [CHECK] → [LOCK]` (plus supporting modules like `[PRUNE]`, `[REPAIR]`, `[TRACE]`, `[ROLLBACK]`, `[SHIFT]`).

**Why it matters**  
- Converts biography and context into **repeatable procedures**.  
- Shortens decision time: when the symbol appears, you **already know** which rule to run.  
- Removes ambiguity: symbols stop being “inspiration” and become **buttons** in a control panel.

### Core Patterns of Symbolic Mapping

1) **Guard/Filter mappings** — define when to clean signals  
- **Japanese 5S → `[PRUNE]`**: remove bloat before reasoning.  
- **AuDHD boundary-warning → `[TONE]` first**: suppress performative tone/emoji; keep prompt verbatim.  

2) **Planning/Structure mappings** — define how to lay out thinking  
- **PCMsys (commissioning) → `[LOGIC]` workpacks**: scope, acceptance criteria, steps before execution.  
- **Programming/Gaming loops → iteration scaffolds**: chunk problems into atomic moves; state machine thinking.

3) **Evidence/Truth mappings** — define the proof gate  
- **“Primary source only” cue → `[VERIFY]`**: attach document/date or mark **Unverified**.  
- **Music: TOOL “Vicarious” (hypocrisy audit) → `[VERIFY] + [CHECK]`**: claim vs conduct scan.

4) **Contradiction/Repair mappings** — define corrective action  
- **Safety punch-list logic → `[CHECK] / [REPAIR]`**: log contradiction as a task; close only with evidence.  
- **Boundary breach → `[SHIFT]`**: realign format after interruption/overload.

5) **Identity/Seal mappings** — define when to finalize  
- **Rune ᛒ → `[LOCK]`**: state is sealed; no silent edits.  
- **Provenance cues (ancestry/trace) → `[TRACE]`**: link fossils so identity is auditable, not reputational.

### Concrete Examples

- **Song → Action**  
  - **TOOL “Descending”** (vigilance) → *When sensing drift*, run `[TONE] → [CHECK]` immediately; open a BLOCK for repairs.  
  - **Eminem “The Way I Am”** (self-definition) → *When labeled online*, don’t debate labels; publish a BLOCK with claim, evidence, contradiction scan, then **ᛒ**.

- **Habit → Action**  
  - **Walking sprint** (AuDHD drive window) → capture idea on mobile as **INTERACTION**, promote to **BLOCK/ENTRY** later.  
  - **Meltdown warning** → pause inputs; run `[SHIFT]` to restore structure before continuing.

- **Tool → Action**  
  - **PCMsys punch-list** → contradictions become **pendências**; close only after `[VERIFY]` proof, then **ᛒ**.  
  - **Obsidian template** → one-tap creates INTERACTION with `Prompt:` verbatim, ensuring H11 compliance.

### How to Create a New Mapping (3 steps)

1) **Name the symbol** (clear, short).  
2) **Assign the rule** (which module(s) it triggers).  
3) **Define the effect** (what must happen next; how it closes).  
Optionally add a quick **test**: “When X shows, do Y within Z minutes.”

**Example:**  
- Symbol: **“Primary or Unverified”**  
- Rule: triggers `[VERIFY]`  
- Effect: attach source; if none, prepend **Unverified** and stop escalation.

### ELI5  
Symbolic mapping is like putting **stickers on buttons**. Each sticker (song, habit, rule) means **press this button** (do this step). So when life shows the sticker, you don’t guess—you **do the step**, and your idea becomes **proof** that nobody can change later.
