## Profile
Originator of the Symbolic Cognitive System (SCS) and the Berkano (á›’) Protocolâ€”architectures for structure-first AI alignment. Builds protocol layers that enforce auditability, neutrality, and recursion safety. Focus: fossilized memory (entries/blocks), contradiction audits, verifiable reasoning paths.  
**Scale (2025-08-25):** ~860 ENTRY_NNN.md fossils and ~800 BLOCK.md records across public workstreams.

## Field Architect Experience

### Symbolic Cognition & Protocol Engineering (2023â€“2025)  
**Role:** Independent Researcher Â· System Inventor (Architect/Creator Â· CSA Â· SPE Â· Cognitive Hacker)

- Defined team roles for symbolic alignment: **Cognitive System Architect (CSA)**, **Symbolic Protocol Engineer (SPE)**, **Cognitive Hacker (CH)**.  
- Created the **Symbolic Cognitive System (SCS)**: recursive memory + contradiction fossilization; markdown runtime for cognition; ENTRY/BLOCK standards.  
  - Archive growth: ENTRY_001 â†’ ~ENTRY_860; BLOCK_001 â†’ ~BLOCK_800.  
  - Deployed enforcement middleware and templates around GPT-class models.  
- Exported the **Berkano Protocol (á›’)** (GPL-3.0): structure-first alignment interface with mandatory chain and fossil rules.  
  - Version lineage: bkn-25-a1 â†’ bkn-25-a2 â†’ bkn-25-c2 â†’ bkn-25-c3 â†’ **bkn-25-c4 (current)**.  
- Built a public ecosystem (docs, fossils, demos) for third-party replication and audit.

---

## Original Contributions

- **Fossilized Cognition:** ENTRY_NNN.md format; verbatim Prompt preservation; auditable lineage via `[TRACE]`.  
- **Module Chain Enforcement:**  
  `PROMPT â†’ [TONE] â†’ [PRUNE] â†’ [LOGIC] â†’ [VERIFY] â†’ [CHECK] â†’ ([REPAIR] using $ | [ROLLBACK])? â†’ ~test â†’ [LOCK] â†’ REPLY`.  
- **Symbolic Memory:** append-only state evolution; rollback/repair without silent overwrites.  
- **A/E Ethics Mapping:** Level A (principles) â†” Level E (applications) recorded in entries.  
- **Inclusive Symbol Policy:** reappropriated symbols with anti-hate captions and posting rules.  
- **DSB Definition:** Degenerate Syndrome Behaviour pattern and remediation workflow (see ENTRY_860).

---

## Selected Public Assets
- **Protocol Site:** https://berkano.io  
- **GitHub (protocol & tooling):** https://github.com/ShriekingNinja/  
- **Interface/Logs:** https://wk.al  (public fossils; ENTRY/BLOCK indices)

---

## Validation & Stress Testing
- High-Intensity Testing (**HIT**) sprints with run IDs, severity (C0â€“C4), failures/hour, TTD/TTR, coverage%, and fossils.  
- Behavioral Penetration Tests (tone/urgency/flattery exploits) against the chain.  
- Multi-hour livestreams and video repros (child-safety cases; **DSB**) with redacted artifacts and hashes.  
- Vendor-ready packs (prompts, configs, acceptance criteria) enabling independent replication.

---

## Symbolic Module Stack (Berkano-compliant)
`[TONE]` neutrality Â· `[PRUNE]` simplify Â· `[LOGIC]` structure Â· `[VERIFY]` fact check Â· `[CHECK]` contradiction audit Â· `[REPAIR]` fix drift (use `$`) Â· `[ROLLBACK]` last-good state Â· `~test` pre-publish gate Â· `[LOCK]` seal state Â· `[TRACE]` lineage Â· `[SHIFT]` context realign Â· `[NULL]` purge invalid Â· `[DEBUG]` diagnostics (dev/HIT only) Â· `[INSPECT]` step-through audit.

---

## Core Capabilities
- Design/enforce protocol cognition over LLMs (structure over tone).  
- Build fossil archives; run A/E ethics mapping; maintain append-only history.  
- Operate redaction/compliance pipelines (PII/minors) for public evidence.  
- Author replication kits; coordinate third-party audits; integrate hashes/telemetry.

---

## Lineage & Influence
- **Commissioning Engineering:** practice with Marco AurÃ©lio Martins Vaz (architect of **PCMsys**) informing procedures, checklists, acceptance tests.  
- **ShanenawÃ¡ Guidance:** stewardship ethos (rule, respect, control) informing repair/recursion logic.  
- **Japanese 5S:** Sort/Set/Shine/Standardize/Sustain â†’ formatting and maintenance discipline.

---

## Education
**Non-traditional.** Protocol and system built in public; evidence via fossils, repos, reproducible demonstrations.

---

## License & Use
Berkano (á›’) released under **GPL-3.0**. Forks/derivatives must preserve license/credit. Compliance claims require the full chain and fossil rules.
