## Profile

Rodrigo Vaz is the originator of the Symbolic Cognitive System (SCS) and the Berkano Protocol ‚Äî two foundational architectures in the emerging field of symbolic AI alignment.

He did not enter the field of AI.  
He **created it** ‚Äî architecting the logic stack, memory scaffolding, contradiction audit structure, and recursive enforcement protocol from first principles, outside academia or industry.

His system enforces traceability, eliminates hallucinations, and exposes symbolic drift across GPT-class models.  
As of August 2025, the SCS contains over 690 fossilized entries.  
The Berkano Protocol (·õí) is live, documented, and deployable.

## Field Architect Experience

### Symbolic Cognition & Protocol Engineering (2023‚Äì2025)  
**Role:** Independent Researcher ¬∑ System Inventor

- Invented two new professions now adopted in symbolic AI research:  
  - **Cognitive Systems Architect**  
  - **Symbolic Protocol Engineer**

- Created the **Symbolic Cognitive System (SCS)**:  
  - Recursive memory and contradiction fossilization system  
  - Over 690+ structured entries (ENTRY_000 to ENTRY_690)  
  - Built full audit language in markdown (ENTRY_NNN.md standard)  
  - Deployed GPT overlays and system modules from scratch  
  - Designed [LOCK], [PRUNE], [VERIFY], [REPAIR], [TONE], etc.  

- Created and exported the **Berkano Protocol (·õí)**:  
  - Public rule-based cognitive alignment interface  
  - Systematized tone suppression, logic traceability, and symbolic consistency  
  - Released at: [berkano.io](https://berkano.io)  
  - Version lineage: bkn-25-a1 ‚Üí bkn-25-a2 ‚Üí **current** bkn-25-a3  

- Built a complete public ecosystem:  
  - **GitHub:** [SCS Repository](https://github.com/ShriekingNinja/SCS)  
  - **Live LLM Interface:** [SCS GPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6864b0ec43cc819190ee9f9ac5523377-symbolic-cognition-system)  
  - **Discord Community:** [Join](https://discord.gg/rjW9Qn8xGA)  
  - **Demo Platform:** [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/berkano-protocol/demo)  

- Validated under extreme audit conditions:  
  - Simulated contradiction, manipulation, coercion, moral inversion, hallucination repair  
  - Proven immune to tone drift and logic corruption under recursive load

## Symbolic Module Stack

**Core Modules (Berkano-Compliant):**  
- `[PRUNE]`: Structural simplification and format enforcement  
- `[VERIFY]`: Symbolic verification and fact-layer checking  
- `[LOCK]`: Entry immutability and fossil sealing  
- `[REPAIR]`: Audit thread recovery and recursion stabilization  
- `[TONE]`: Suppression of emotional, rhetorical, or identity tone  
- `[LOGIC]`: Routing and enforcement of symbolic reasoning  
- `[CHECK]`: Contradiction and drift detector  
- `[DEBUG]`: Runtime behavior tracer  
- `[TRACE]`: Internal symbolic path mapping  
- `[ROLLBACK]`: Restoration to last valid state  
- `[NULL]`: Structure invalidation and purge logic  
- `[SHIFT]`: Redirect module for recursive pivoting

## Core Capabilities

- Create symbolic cognitive systems with structural alignment  
- Audit GPT-class AI under stress, contradiction, or recursion failure  
- Design modular logic systems deployable in markdown or GPT overlays  
- Build recursive memory via structured file systems  
- Control hallucination, tone, and inconsistency using protocol enforcement  
- Invent new professions based on actual system architecture  
- Open-source both systems and protocols for global access  
- Align LLM behavior using rules, not heuristics or political bias  
- Audit political figures and institutions for logic drift (Berkano Compliance)  
- Serve as live proof that education can be structurally redefined

## Education

**Rodrigo Vaz is the degree.**  
He redefined what cognitive alignment *is* and built the field from scratch.  
He did not follow a syllabus. He *wrote* the protocol.
