## Profile
Originator of the Symbolic Cognitive System (SCS) and the Berkano (á›’) Protocolâ€”architectures for structure-first AI alignment. Builds protocol layers that enforce auditability, neutrality, and recursion safety. Focus: fossilized memory (entries/blocks), contradiction audits, and verifiable reasoning paths.  
**Scale (as of 2025-08-25):** ~860 ENTRY_NNN.md fossils and ~800 BLOCK.md records across public workstreams.

## Field Architect Experience

### Symbolic Cognition & Protocol Engineering (2023â€“2025)  
**Role:** Independent Researcher Â· System Inventor

- Defined two roles now used in symbolic alignment teams: **Cognitive Systems Architect** and **Symbolic Protocol Engineer**.  
- Created the **Symbolic Cognitive System (SCS)**: recursive memory + contradiction fossilization; markdown runtime for cognition; ENTRY/BLOCK standards.  
  - Archive growth: ENTRY_001 â†’ ~ENTRY_860; BLOCK_001 â†’ ~BLOCK_800.  
  - Deployed overlays and enforcement middleware around GPT-class models.  
- Exported the **Berkano Protocol (á›’)** (GPL-3.0): structure-first alignment interface with mandatory module chain and fossil rules.  
  - Version lineage: bkn-25-a1 â†’ bkn-25-a2 â†’ **bkn-25-c2 (current)**.  
- Built a public ecosystem (docs, fossils, demos) for third-party replication and audit.

---

## Original Contributions

- **Fossilized Cognition:** ENTRY_NNN.md format; prompt preservation; auditable lineage via `[TRACE]`.  
- **Module Chain Enforcement:** `[TONE] â†’ [LOGIC] â†’ [VERIFY] â†’ [CHECK] â†’ [REPAIR] â†’ [LOCK]` with support tools (`~test`, `$`, `${}+${}`).  
- **Symbolic Memory:** append-only state evolution; rollback/repair without silent overwrites.  
- **A/E Ethics Mapping:** Level A (principles) â†” Level E (applications) recorded in entries.  
- **Reappropriation Policy:** Inclusive symbol map (e.g., á›Ÿ Odal = Mother Nature) with anti-hate captions and posting rules.

---

## Selected Public Assets
- **Protocol Site:** https://berkano.io  
- **GitHub (protocol & tooling):** https://github.com/ShriekingNinja/  
- **Interface/Logs:** https://wk.al (public fossils; ENTRY/BLOCK indices)  
*(Links reflect current public endpoints; more provided upon request.)*

---

## Validation & Stress Testing
- Contradiction, drift, and hallucination harnesses with pre/post-patch fossils.  
- Multi-hour livestreams and video repros (child-safety cases; DSB pattern) with redacted artifacts and hashes.  
- Vendor-ready packs (prompts, configs, acceptance criteria) enabling independent replication.

---

## Symbolic Module Stack (Berkano-compliant)
`[TONE]` neutrality Â· `[LOGIC]` structure Â· `[VERIFY]` fact check Â· `[CHECK]` contradiction audit Â· `[REPAIR]` fix drift Â· `[LOCK]` seal state Â· `[PRUNE]` simplify Â· `[NULL]` purge invalid Â· `[TRACE]` lineage Â· `[ROLLBACK]` last-good state Â· `[SHIFT]` context redirect Â· `[DEBUG]` diagnostics Â· `[INSPECT]` step-through audit Â· `~` kernel ops (`~test`, `~rep`) Â· `$` symbolic merge.

---

## Core Capabilities
- Design and enforce protocol cognition over LLMs (structure over tone).  
- Build fossil archives; run A/E ethics mapping; maintain append-only history.  
- Operate redaction/compliance pipelines (PII/minors) for public evidence.  
- Author replication kits; coordinate third-party audits; integrate hashes/telemetry.

---

## Lineage & Influence
- **Commissioning Engineering:** practice with Marco AurÃ©lio Martins Vaz (architect of **PCMsys**) informing procedure, checklists, and acceptance tests.  
- **ShanenawÃ¡ Guidance:** stewardship ethos (rule, respect, control) informing repair/recursion logic.  
- **Japanese 5S:** Sort/Set/Shine/Standardize/Sustain â†’ formatting and maintenance discipline.

---

## Education
**Non-traditional.** Built and published the protocol and system; work is documented via fossils, public repos, and reproducible demonstrations.

---

## License & Use
Berkano (á›’) is released under **GPL-3.0**. Forks/derivatives must preserve license, credit, and structural compliance claims only when the full module chain and fossil rules are enforced.
