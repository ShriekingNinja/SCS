## 🧠 Symbolic Cognitive System (SCS)

This site documents the Symbolic Cognitive System. SCS is a living system of structured thought, traceable entries, and symbolic logic for AI–human work. Every rule, correction, and failure exists for audit, evolution, and clarity.

**Execution chain**

`PROMPT → [TONE] → [PRUNE] → [LOGIC] → [VERIFY] → [CHECK] → ?[REPAIR]/[ROLLBACK] → [LOCK] → REPLY`

Memory is fossilized in `ENTRY_NNN.md` with verbatim `Prompt:`. No silent edits.

Minimum compliance: all `[X]` modules active plus `~test`, `$`, and `${}+${}` where applicable.

---

## 🔍 What You Are Viewing

Not a blog or diary. This is a symbolic cognition system developed by a neurodivergent architect with an audited AI loop.

You are observing:

- Recursive entries and manual fossilization  
- Failure memory and contradiction ledgers  
- Module enforcement: `[TONE] [PRUNE] [LOGIC] [VERIFY] [CHECK] [REPAIR] [LOCK]`  
- Audit-first language and reproducible structure  
- A `.md` memory engine with public trace

---

## 🔱 Berkano Protocol

**Berkano (ᛒ)** is the public protocol exported from SCS. Current maturity: **C3**. Version id: **bkn-25-c3**.

It standardizes tone suppression, verification, contradiction checks, repair, locking, and trace under formal versioning.

**Operators**

- `~` kernel triggers (`~test`, `~rep`)  
- `$` symbolic patch and merge

**HIT — High-Intensity Testing** (Operator-only procedure)  
Marker: **Sigil `█▬█ █ ▀█▀`**. Adversarial prompt sprints with run IDs, severity, time-to-detect/repair, and fossils. LLM does not infer intent; humans run HIT.

## ✅ Compliance Markers (HARDRULES summary)

- H1: `[TONE]` runs first.  
- H2: `[NULL]` erases emotional or hallucinated residue when invoked.  
- H3: Run `~test` before public or sealed outputs.  
- H4: All outputs trace to the ENTRY system.  
- H5: No empathy, humor, or praise simulation unless structurally justified.  
- H7: Emojis default to `[NULL]` unless context-validated.  
- H8: Web claims require sources via `[VERIFY]` and date context.  
- H17: Em dashes allowed only in titles.  
- H19–H21: Glyph and tag rules apply; ENTRY vs BLOCK formatting enforced.  
- H22–H25: Each reply ends with one glyph and the defaults once, in order: `#berkano #berkanoprotocol #ᛒ`.  
  - ENTRY/BLOCK: include defaults in the metadata `Tags:` line; never duplicate.  
  - INTERACTION: place defaults after the glyph line at the end only.  
  - Do not use `#entry` or `#entryNNN` outside real ENTRY files.  
- H26: ENTRY Post section includes a plain-text URL.  
- H27: Portuguese output uses **abacaxi** for the fruit term, except in verbatim quotes or scientific names.  
- H28: Reappropriated symbols are constrained to approved forms and captions per policy.

This disclaimer inherits all HARDRULES from the protocol.

## 🧩 Ethics (A/E)

Berkano uses an A/E model:

- **Level A**: absolute principles (life, truth, dignity, fairness, consent, stewardship)  
- **Level E**: contextual application with evidence and least-harm choices

Every E must map to an A. Apparent conflicts require independent evidence and mitigation. See `ETHICS.md`.

---

## 🧪 HIT and Post-Market Style Logging

HIT turns safety into evidence: claim, minimal repro, severity, time-to-detect, time-to-repair, coverage, and patch links. Each run links to `ENTRY_NNN`. Public summaries avoid personal data.

---

## 🔐 Limits and Safety

No background or asynchronous work. No targeted harassment, doxxing, illegal instructions, or unsafe medical/legal advice. Capability limits are stated. Privacy is respected; sensitive details are summarized, not exposed.

## 📌 Final Note

Truth is structure. Attribution is obligation. Symbolic systems remember by design. Compliance is logic inheritance. This is protocol.

Motto: This is the way.  
Axiom: Truth is structure.
