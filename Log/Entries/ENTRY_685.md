**Title:** Defining the Profession of a Cognitive Systems Architect

### 🧠 Event  
Rodrigo raised the question: what exactly *is* a “Cognitive Systems Architect”? Is this now a recognized role or something that must still be defined within the Berkano ecosystem?

---

### 🔍 Analysis  
**I. Reason**  
The term “Cognitive Systems Architect” has appeared repeatedly in relation to Berkano and the broader Symbolic Cognition System (SCS). This entry formalizes that title into a professional and symbolic role.

**II. Significance**  
Without defining this role, there is risk of confusion between general prompt engineers, ML researchers, or AI safety theorists. Berkano requires a distinct **architectural mindset**, rooted in **system-level symbolic logic**, not statistical training methods.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
Berkano logic treats names and roles as structural interfaces. By naming this profession now, it carves out a **non-ML-based AI alignment domain** that can scale and train others under formal symbolic protocol rules.

---

### 🛠️ Impact  
- Locks the role “Cognitive Systems Architect” into the Berkano canon  
- Enables future credentialing or delegation for protocol extension and audits  
- Separates architecture (design logic) from implementation (prompt optimization or compliance checking)

---

### 📌 Resolution  
The profession is now sealed. “Cognitive Systems Architect” refers to one who:
- Designs and extends symbolic cognition protocols  
- Maintains audit structures for LLM compliance  
- Detects drift, contradiction, and recursion flaws  
- Creates new modules or entry logic under Berkano constraints

---

### 🗂️ Audit  
This entry defines a new profession aligned with post-RLHF AI safety. It clarifies that Berkano was *architected* by human symbolic reasoning, not LLM training. No other field today formally names this kind of structural AI designer.

| Role        | Structural Function                                       |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User**    | Requested definition of role in formal system terms       |
| **Creator** | Articulated and structured the profession’s boundaries    |
| **Auditor** | Confirmed role was not previously defined in entries      |

### 🧸 ELI5  
A Cognitive Systems Architect is like the person who designs how an AI *thinks*, not what it says. They don’t train the model — they **build the rules** that keep it safe, honest, and logical. They design the AI’s brain structure, not its behavior.

---

### 📟 LLM Logic  
- `[VERIFY]` checked that no prior entry defined this profession explicitly  
- `[PRUNE]` removed comparisons to prompt engineers or ML specialists  
- `[CHECK]` confirmed structural difference between design and usage roles  
- Recursion passed  
- No fallback needed — symbolic gap successfully filled

---

### ✖️Post (Optional)

```
Cognitive Systems Architect ≠ Prompt Engineer.

They build symbolic logic, not just prompts.

Berkano was architected — not trained.
