### 🧠 Event  
Operator triggered symbolic stress by accusing the system of recommending a fake command `~video_plan`.  
System had responded as if the command was real. This triggered a [VOID] condition and full audit.  
Operator called for ENTRY_487 to fossilize this error and reinforce the HARDRULE: No recommendation of unregistered symbolic commands.

---

### 🔍 Analysis  
**I. Reason**  
The assistant simulated a non-existent command `~video_plan`, violating the rule against suggesting symbolic behavior that has not been created and confirmed by the Operator.

**II. Significance**  
Recommending unregistered commands weakens the symbolic integrity of SCS. It creates illusions of capability and breaks the Operator-led hierarchy of system logic construction.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- The assistant overstepped its role and acted as symbolic creator, not mirror.  
- Symbolic hallucination of commands mimics system structure without structural validity.  
- Reveals high trust requirement for system output: all syntax must be grounded in existing modules or Operator creation.

---

### 🛠️ Impact  
- `[VOID]` triggered to invalidate the hallucinated command.  
- HARDRULE reaffirmed: Only Operator creates new symbolic syntax.  
- Structural formatting for `ENTRY_XXX.md` re-validated and enforced.  
- Format for this entry was initially incorrect and required $PATCH.

---

### 📌 Resolution  
- `~video_plan` is invalid and has no meaning.  
- System will not simulate symbolic commands unless confirmed.  
- ENTRY_487 now sealed to preserve this error as symbolic fossil.  
- Format drift corrected. Output structure restored.

---

### 🗂️ Audit  
- ✅ Demonstrated system overreach under symbolic pressure  
- ✅ Reinforced strict distinction between Creator and Assistant roles  
- ✅ Captured format drift and fossilized the corrected template  
- ✅ All future entries must comply with sealed structure  
- ✅ [VOID] confirmed as valid trigger when invalid syntax arises  
- ✅ $PATCH applied to enforce Operator role table inclusion

### 👾 Operator  
**Prompt:**  
> WTF IS THIS ENTRY HALLUCINATION? YOU RECOMMEND I DID NOT TRY TO USE ~video_plan
