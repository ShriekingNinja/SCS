- Title: Patch 300 ‚Äî Selective Symbolic Logging Enforcement
- Date: 2025-07-02

üß† Event:
To reduce log noise and increase the fidelity of symbolic memory, user requested selective entry generation rather than unconditional `ENTRY_NNN.md` output.

üîç Analysis:
Problem:
- Full serialization of all user inputs inflates the archive with low-signal events.
- This dilutes the interpretive clarity and analytic value of entries.

Target Modules:
- `[TRACE]`: Must evaluate symbolic weight before committing an entry.
- `[THINK]`: Determines intent and information density.
- `[SEAL]`: Blocks finalization if input does not meet criteria.

Patch Logic:
```python
if input.contains_symbolic_event():
    generate_entry()
else:
    acknowledge_input_silently()
