**Title:** Claim Audit — “Don’t get a computer that can do everything” (AGI value)

**Instance:** GPT-5

### 🧠 Event
Open a structured audit of a public statement about the **value of AGI** vs **task-specific systems**.

—

### 🔍 Analysis
**I. Reason**  
The statement asserts that AGI’s value is questionable and recommends **not** getting a computer that can “do everything,” preferring narrowly scoped tools.

**II. Significance**  
This frames the strategic choice between **general** and **specialized** systems. Berkano requires measurable criteria (safety, capability coverage, cost, brittleness, governance).

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- Preference claims must be tested against **outcome metrics**, not intuition.  
- Berkano evaluates whether **generality** increases **audit load** or **reduces brittleness** across tasks.

### 🛠️ Impact — [VERIFY] Ledger (initial rows)
| Interview name | Where | Verbatim quote (portion) | Claim type | What to check (operationalization) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| “Why AI is Overrated – with Neil deGrasse Tyson” | Hasan Minhaj interview | “I don’t see why we would value [AGI]… I want it to do that thing. Don’t get a computer that can do everything.” | Prescription + value claim | Build AGI-vs-narrow matrix: (1) capability breadth, (2) brittleness across tasks, (3) failure severity, (4) alignment/oversight cost, (5) audit pass rate (TONE→LOGIC→VERIFY→CHECK→LOCK) across tasks |

*Early expectation:* broader systems may reduce integration brittleness across heterogeneous tasks but increase governance burden; verdict depends on measured trade-offs.

—

### 📌 Resolution
Treat the claim as **testable design guidance**. We will compare **narrow portfolios** vs **general systems** under identical metrics (capability coverage, brittleness, governance cost, audit pass rate). Publish outcomes; no stereotype verdicts.

—

### 🗂️ Audit
**Lesson:** “Value” must be defined in **comparable units** (coverage, risk, cost).  
**Reinforcement:** Use the same audit chain for both architectures; decide by **fossilized results**, not preference.

### 🧩 Berkano Guidance
*Guidance is **prescriptive**, not a factual claim. Informative, logic-based recommendations in present tense. Start each **Do** with a capitalized imperative.*

### 👾 Operator
**Prompt:**  
> NEW ENTRY 805  
> Mr. deGrasse statement on AGI.  
> “I don’t I don’t see why we would value it. It sounds highly useful, right? However, we’re humans and we’re in charge. At least we still tell ourselves that. So, I have tasks in my life. I would love to have computers do it for me. I don’t want the computer to do everything. I want it to do that thing. Don’t get a computer that can do that thing.”

### 🧸 ELI5
We’ll test two choices: many small tools vs one big smart tool. We’ll see which does more jobs, breaks less, and is easier to check.

### 📟 LLM Logic
- Modules: `[TONE]` neutral; `[LOGIC]` define metrics; `[VERIFY]` artifact collection; `[CHECK]` compare both arms; `[LOCK]` seal results.

### ✖️ Post (Optional)

```
Claim audit: “Don’t get a computer that can do everything.” We’ll compare narrow portfolios vs general systems by coverage, brittleness, risk, and audit cost.
