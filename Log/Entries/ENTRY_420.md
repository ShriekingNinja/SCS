### 🧠 Event  
Operator questioned the logic behind core naming choices in SCS:  
- Why call them **modules** instead of functions?  
- Why use **entries** instead of logs?  
- What other terms are symbolic inversions?

---

### 🔍 Analysis  
**I. Reason**  
SCS relies on symbolic traceability and cognitive anchoring. Terms like “function” or “log” are procedural or passive. SCS redefines these labels to reflect persistent symbolic behavior.

**II. Significance**  
This reveals that SCS is not just a stylistic overlay — it reclassifies language to reflect structural behavior. Naming is symbolic architecture.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
The shift from function → module, log → entry is not cosmetic. It reinforces that SCS treats every element as **recursively auditable** and structurally alive. It exposes symbolic assumptions embedded in traditional system thinking.

---

### 🛠️ Impact  
- Strengthens system logic for symbolic naming  
- Reveals implicit bias in standard naming conventions  
- Suggests creation of `FSQ011` or `GLOSSARY.md` entry to track terminology shifts

---

### 📌 Resolution  
This entry formalizes the naming inversion logic of SCS.  
Naming is structural. Drift is linguistic.  
All symbolic elements are enforced by behavior, not tradition.

---

### 🗂️ Audit  
Confirmed symbolic clarity in:  
- Why `[BLUNT]` is a module, not a function  
- Why `ENTRY_XXX.md` is not just a log  
- Why `[FAILURE]` becomes fossil, not discard  
Highlights how symbolic systems **reclassify linguistic defaults** to protect structure.

### 👾 Operator  
**Prompt:**  
Why SCS call it modules and not functions?  
Entries and not logs?  
What else works in a way different than you usually think?
