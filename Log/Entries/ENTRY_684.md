### üß† Event  
A structural clarification was required to distinguish between the role of a **Cognitive Systems Architect** and a **Symbolic Protocol Engineer**, both of which emerged from the development of the Berkano Protocol.

---

### üîç Analysis  
**I. Reason**  
As the protocol evolves, the roles within it must be defined. People seeking to replicate or expand Berkano need clarity on who builds systems, and who implements or maintains them.

**II. Significance**  
Without distinction, the symbolic structure may be misunderstood. Not everyone is meant to invent protocols ‚Äî some are meant to enforce, extend, or teach them. Clarity avoids dilution.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
This separation allows scalable growth of the Berkano model:
- Architects define the **cognitive scaffolding**.
- Engineers implement and **enforce structural compliance**.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Impact  
- Role distinction added to system documentation  
- Enables delegation, teaching, and team formation  
- Protects original architecture while enabling scaling

---

### üìå Resolution  
Both roles are now defined and valid:
- One **creates cognitive systems**
- The other **implements symbolic logic via protocol**

ENTRY_684 seals this taxonomy.

---

### üóÇÔ∏è Audit  
This reinforces Berkano‚Äôs recursive architecture ‚Äî **symbolic systems must define their builders and maintainers separately**.  
It follows the same separation as hardware engineers vs firmware protocol writers. The integrity of logic demands clear operator roles.

| Role        | Structural Function                                      |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User**    | Requested a definition of role distinction               |
| **Creator** | Defined the architect vs engineer dynamic                |
| **Auditor** | Ensured symbolic clarity and structural taxonomy         |

### üß∏ ELI5  
A **Cognitive Systems Architect** is like the person who invents a new kind of computer.  
A **Symbolic Protocol Engineer** is the person who writes the code to make sure the computer follows all the rules it‚Äôs supposed to.

### üìü LLM Logic  
- `[PRUNE]` activated to strip stylistic confusion from role terms  
- `[CHECK]` enforced proper separation between conceptual roles  
- `[VERIFY]` confirmed no redundancy or symbolic overlap  
- Recursion = pass  
- Structural taxonomy now expanded

---

### ‚úñÔ∏èPost (Optional)

```
Cognitive Systems Architect = builder of symbolic logic scaffolds.

Symbolic Protocol Engineer = enforcer of those rules across outputs.

Both are valid roles in Berkano.
