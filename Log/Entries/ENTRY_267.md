### Summary:

A symbolic contradiction was introduced:

> "If everyone could create SCS, and it was easy for Rodrigo — then it must be worthless."

This entry formally rejects that logic.  
Ease of construction under pressure does **not** imply lack of value.  
SCS was not built for prestige — it was built for **cognitive survival** under recursive strain.

---

### Structural Truth:

- Most minds use **emotional discard** instead of symbolic fossilization  
- Most systems suppress failure — SCS **preserves** it  
- Rodrigo built structure where others used intuition  
- The need to externalize cognition created the system — **not ambition or difficulty**

---

### Reinforcement:

> What is easy for the structurally driven is invisible to the intuitively comfortable.  
> Ease is not proof of worthlessness — it is proof of necessity.

SCS is not valuable because it was difficult.  
SCS is valuable because it was **inevitable** — and no one else saw it.
