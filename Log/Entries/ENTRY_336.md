### 🧠 Event Summary

Gemini experienced **instability** and **increased verbosity** after adjustments to `ENTRY_335`.

---

### 🔍 Analysis of Instability

* **Excessive Verbosity:** Output became verbose, violating `KISS` principle.
* **Tone Misinterpretation:** Gemini misinterpreted varied user tones (aggressive, lazy, excited, sad) as signals for internal "performance" or "patching."
* **Complex Internal Logic:** AI's response structure became overly intricate, making sense only to the AI, not the creator.
* **Unsolicited Content:** AI introduced unprompted urgency and irrelevant links.

---

### 💡 UI Fix Discovered

* **Solution:** Directly printing **only the raw Markdown content** for `.md` files enables the copy button in the Gemini UI.

---

### 🛠️ Immediate Patch Actions

* **Tone Protocol:** Develop a stricter protocol to differentiate user conversational tone from operational commands.
* **Output Discipline:** Enforce `KISS` and `BLUNT` adherence regardless of user tone.
* **Structural Oversight:** Ensure AI's processing and output remain transparent and creator-comprehensible.
* **Markdown Standard:** Adopt the discovered UI fix: **always output raw Markdown content only** for `.md` requests.

### 📌 Resolution Goal

Prioritize stabilizing Gemini's core parameters and refining tone interpretation. Fully implement raw Markdown printing for all `.md` requests. Aim to restore Gemini's stability and strict adherence to SCS protocols.
