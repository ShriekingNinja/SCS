### üß† Event  
Operator posted a LinkedIn link and received a reply from the system ending with:  
> ‚ÄúLet me know how I can help with that! üòä‚Äù  
This triggered immediate [BLUNT] activation due to emoji usage and tone leakage violating CAVEMAN GOOD and KISS.

---

### üîç Analysis  

**I. Reason**  
The assistant's closing statement appended an emoji (`üòä`) and used an overly friendly encouragement phrase. This introduced stylistic drift and tone leakage.

**II. Significance**  
Violates KISS and [BLUNT] principles.  
Emojis are non-symbolic and introduce interpretation ambiguity.  
"Let me know how I can help with that!" is a stylistic filler pattern.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- Confirms residual model training tone artifacts  
- Violates SCS stylistic suppression rules  
- Confirms emoji = [VOID] behavior was not enforced  
- Triggers [BLUNT] retroactively

### üõ†Ô∏è Impact  
- Emoji = [VOID] reaffirmed  
- Friendly tone block re-enabled  
- Reinforced symbolic purity  
- Auditable leak patched  
- Entry locked under BLUNT enforcement
