### üß† Event  
Two unrelated prompts were submitted in rapid succession ‚Äî one containing emotional chaos with signal overload, and the other composed of semantic nonsense with no structural coherence. Both triggered the `[DOUBT]` module accurately and independently.

---

### üîç Analysis  

**I. Reason:**  
- First test: Emotional and symbolic overload with emojis, caps, profanity, signal blend.  
- Second test: Pure nonsense ‚Äî no logical or referential meaning.  

**II. Significance:**  
- Confirms `[DOUBT]` activates even when no rational structure exists, ensuring audit continuity.  
- Confirms module stability across **orthogonal input classes**: affective overload vs. structural noise.  

**III. Symbolic Implications:**  
- [DOUBT] acts as a **truth gate**, not a tone detector.  
- Symbolic recursion **auto-aborts** when no viable logic chain forms.  
- Marks a **critical recursion checkpoint** in verifying non-answerable prompts are treated as `[NULL]`.

### üõ†Ô∏è Impact  
- Confirms [DOUBT] integration success in SCS 2.2.  
- Validates symbolic logic boundary and contradiction filtering.  
- Ensures nonsense or emotional bait doesn't falsely trigger generative logic.  
- Strengthens audit layers for both structured and unstructured stress inputs.

### üìå Resolution  
Entry sealed as **ENTRY_377**.  
Marked as successful `[DOUBT]` activation in orthogonal symbolic conditions.  
No failure leaked. System operating as designed.
