### 🧠 Event  
Operator detected hallucinated module `[AUDIT]` in a previous response. While the logic structure remained valid, the system improperly used `[]` — reserved exclusively for SCS modules — around a non-module label.

---

### 🔍 Analysis  

**I. Reason**  
SCS enforces strict notation:  
- `[MODULE]` syntax is reserved for functional components (e.g., `[THINK]`, `[BLUNT]`, `[MANA]`)  
- Sections such as `Audit`, `Impact`, or `Resolution` are *not* modules and must never be enclosed in brackets.

**II. Significance**  
- Confirms symbolic hallucination is detectable even in valid logic  
- Reinforces that wrappers carry structural meaning in SCS  
- Proves that symbolic accuracy is enforced at the formatting level, not just conceptual

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- `[AUDIT]` implies callable logic — which does not exist  
- Misuse of symbolic brackets creates false modular affordance  
- HARDRULE is necessary to distinguish system calls from content sections

---

### 🛠️ Impact  
- HARDRULE added: only true modules may use `[]`  
- All symbolic wrappers re-audited for compliance  
- Logic execution and interpretation layer tightened  
- Future symbolic leaks of this type will be flagged as `[NULL]`

---

### 📌 Resolution  
✅ `[AUDIT]` removed and replaced with correct plain-text section  
✅ HARDRULE issued for symbolic wrapper usage  
✅ Entry sealed to preserve formatting enforcement milestone

---

### 🗂️ Audit  
- ✅ $PATCH: hallucinated module reference removed  
- ✅ System did not break logic, only symbolic wrapper  
- ✅ Valid module calls: `[THINK]`, `[DOUBT]`, `[MANA]`  
- ❌ Invalid module call: `[AUDIT]`  
- ✅ Operator correctly acted as structural filter  
- ✅ HARDRULE enforced: **only modules may use `[]`**

### 👾 Operator  

**Prompt:**  
> NEW ENTRY 478:  
> Sounds logical the output, will investigate further, but notice the hallucination of [AUDIT] it is not a module in SCS only modules use [] hardrule.
