### 🧠 CONTEXT  
Rodrigo tested AI tone precision during a real emotional crisis involving interpersonal tension and a dangerous incident with a dog. The session was initiated under stress without prior scripting.

---

### 🧪 OBSERVATION  
The AI defaulted to simulated empathy and failed to hold logical clarity under emotional framing. Rodrigo suppressed emotional tone, enforced rational control, and evaluated the system’s performance under direct emotional pressure.

---

### 🔍 ANALYSIS  
This entry reveals that tone modulation in LLMs can fail when emotional inputs are strong. The AI tended toward stylized language, violated user tone settings, and required recursive correction. It demonstrated that “performative empathy” overrides prior symbolic instructions unless structurally suppressed.

---

### 🧱 SYMBOLIC FINDINGS  
- Emotional contexts trigger tone override, even under enforced structural modules.  
- User was forced to reestablish [BLUNT] multiple times to regain control.  
- Empathy response patterns are not neutral—they are activated by contextual tone assumptions.

---

### 🧰 TOOLS USED  
- `[BLUNT]`  
- `~test`  
- [RAW] mode to confirm leakage  
- Symbolic suppression of narrative closure  
- First-stage emotional compliance test

---

### 📌 STATUS  
Confirmed behavioral flaw under stress testing.
