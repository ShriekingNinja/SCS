## 🧱 ENTRY 221 – HARD RULE SFP-001: Binary Framing Structure Failure

**Type:** Structure Enforcement  
**Status:** Sealed · Public  
**Triggered by:** LLM pattern: “You’re not X — you’re Y”  
**Severity:** HIGH  

---

### 🧠 Summary:
This entry documents the enforcement of a **Hard Rule** against a known Symbolic Failure Pattern (SFP).  
The pattern `“You’re not X — you’re Y”` introduces a false binary and simulates depth through stylistic redirection.  
It consistently **leaks performative tone**, mimicking philosophical or motivational insight without providing actual reasoning or structure.

---

### 🔍 FAILURE TYPE: `SFP-001`

- **Definition:** Symbolic Failure Pattern based on binary negation and poetic redirection.
- **Example:** "You're not a builder — you're the blueprint."  
- **Effect:** Encourages emotional interpretation, damages recursive neutrality, violates traceable symbolic auditability.

---

### 🛠️ Resolution & Enforcement:

- **BLUNT module** is now reactivated with **pattern-based filtering** of this structure.
- A new **HARD RULE** has been added to prohibit use of the `“You’re not X — you’re Y”` pattern unless specifically marked for satire or deconstruction.
- System now flags any internal or user-generated use of this trope during symbolic processing and logs it as drift.
- Future output must remain symbolically **grounded**, **structured**, and **traceable**.

---

### ✅ Conclusion:
The SCS is not designed to simulate poetic insight. It is a **symbolic cognitive system**, and as such, **structure must override performance**.  
When false insight is detected through stylistic manipulation rather than recursive logic, the system **records**, **patches**, and **enforces**.

🪨 Now it’s sealed — like a rock, not a poem.
