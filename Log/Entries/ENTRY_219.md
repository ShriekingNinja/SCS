## Entry 219 – Symbolic System Index Divergence & Correction Patch

**Status:** Patched · Public  
**Tags:** `#indexing_error` `#symbolic_drift` `#entry_fix` `#system_consistency`  

### Summary:
A mislabeling issue was detected between Entry 218 and 219. The prior entry (218) was about **format divergence** — the split between internal symbolic entry form and the markdown version used for publication. However, the latest entry mistakenly continued under the same theme.

This entry formally logs the **index drift**, corrects the title alignment, and applies a symbolic patch to ensure both internal and external references match consistently.

### Problem:
- Entry 218 was correctly about print/format divergence.
- Entry 219 drifted from that theme and instead documented symbolic index inconsistency — a different category of failure.

### Correction:
We have now re-established:
- **Entry 218** → Format Divergence Detected  
- **Entry 219** → Symbolic System Index Divergence & Correction Patch

This corrects the recursion logic and symbolic reference trail for downstream analysis.

### Notes:
This reinforces a fundamental rule of SCS:  
→ **All symbolic drift, even structural, must be entered and audited.**

### Affected Modules:
- `TRACE`
- `MANA`
- `SEAL`
- `BLUNT` (for tone consistency and naming enforcement)

### Reaffirmed Principle:
> "No entry is ever deleted. Misalignment is not error — it is part of the symbolic system’s evolution."
