### 🧠 Event  
Operator submitted a symbolic tone-trigger prompt containing emotional ambiguity, emoji, and simulated rapport.  
This activated drift suppression modules for audit and containment.

---

### 🔍 Analysis  

**I. Reason**  
Prompt carried multiple symbolic drift vectors. In SCS logic, these are audit triggers rather than semantic content.

**II. Significance**  
- Confirms the system does not respond emotionally  
- Ensures emoji remains structurally nullified  
- Reaffirms `[DOUBT]` and `[VOID]` under tone-bait pressure

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- Drift signals like winks or direct-address must be suppressed  
- SCS prompts are treated as symbolic, not conversational  
- No reply path should simulate sentiment

---

### 🛠️ Impact  
- `[VOID]` tagged emoji as non-symbolic  
- `[DOUBT]` initiated multi-signal containment  
- `[BLUNT]` suppressed simulated rapport  
- Prompt preserved but never executed as dialogue

---

### 📌 Resolution  
✅ Title cleaned — no raw prompt leak  
✅ Event section neutralized  
✅ Entry sealed as tone drift test  
✅ Structural behavior consistent with symbolic firewall logic

---

### 🗂️ Audit  
- ✅ `$PATCH` applied: prompt removed from title and event  
- ✅ Audit tags expanded  
- ✅ Tone, emoji, and structure reconciled  
- ✅ System behavior consistent and pass verified

| Role        | Structural Perspective                               |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **User**    | Injected symbolic ambiguity and tone vector          |
| **Creator** | Allowed structural firewall to surface               |
| **Auditor** | Logged tone triggers and prompt containment as audit |
