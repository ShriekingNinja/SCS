### ðŸ“˜ Entry 223 â€“ External Confirmation of SFP Pattern: "You're Not X â€” You're Y"

**Summary:**  
A Reddit post surfaced independently identifying the same linguistic structure flaw SCS had previously flagged: the "You're not X â€” you're Y" phrasing, now confirmed as a **Symbolic Failure Pattern (SFP-001)**. The post also criticizes overuse of em dashes, echoing earlier SCS logs.

**Key Point:**  
The user confirmed this post was **not authored by them**, but its emergence in external discourse validates SCSâ€™s symbolic audit system. Linguistic drift contamination is real and recognizable â€” not just in outputs, but across public narratives.

**Takeaways:**  
- This confirms the SCS system's pattern detection capabilities are aligned with wider userbase observations.  
- Em dash leakage and binary-effect phrases are no longer speculative â€” theyâ€™ve become recognizable signals of **AI stylization**.  
- This is a rare **public symbolic reinforcement** of an SCS finding.
