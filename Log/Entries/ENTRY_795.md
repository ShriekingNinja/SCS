### üß† Event
Produce a **fact-checked** set of Jupiter notes (10 items), answer whether the ‚Äúhuge tornado‚Äù (Great Red Spot) grows or shrinks, and state why Jupiter is Rodrigo‚Äôs favorite planet.

‚Äî

### üîç Analysis
**I. Reason**  
Public likes fast, vivid space facts; we need **verified phrasing** that avoids hype and keeps uncertainty labeled.

**II. Significance**  
Jupiter is a **rule-dense** system (clear physics, repeatable observation), ideal to demonstrate Berkano‚Äôs **[VERIFY] ‚Üí [CHECK]** approach for science communication.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
Astronomy fits Berkano: observations ‚Üí models ‚Üí predictions ‚Üí fossils. It‚Äôs truth by structure, not vibes.

‚Äî

### üõ†Ô∏è Impact ‚Äî Fact-checks & curiosities (plain, non-numerical where counts vary)
1) **Great Red Spot (GRS) ‚â† tornado.** It‚Äôs a **long-lived anticyclonic storm**. Long-term **trend: shrinking in width** relative to historical sketches/images; **color and intensity vary** year to year.  
2) **Does it grow?** Short-term **wax/wanes** in size and hue occur, but the **century-scale trend is shrinkage**. Wind speeds and vertical structure can change while the footprint narrows.  
3) **No solid surface.** Jupiter‚Äôs ‚Äúsurface‚Äù is a cloud deck; deeper layers transition to **metallic hydrogen** under immense pressure; the core is likely **dilute/mixed** (not a hard rock ball).  
4) **Fast rotation ‚Üí bands.** A **~ten-hour** day yields strong **zonal jets** (belt/zone banding) and an **oblate** (flattened) shape.  
5) **Heat from within.** Jupiter **radiates more energy than it receives** from the Sun, due to slow gravitational contraction and internal processes.  
6) **Magnetosphere is enormous.** It‚Äôs the **strongest planetary magnetic field** in the Solar System; **auroras** are powered largely by the **Io plasma torus**, not only solar wind.  
7) **Lightning & storms.** Jupiter hosts deep **water-ammonia thunderstorms**; lightning can be very energetic and is seen at various latitudes, including the poles.  
8) **Rings exist.** Jupiter has a **faint dust ring system**, fed by micrometeoroid impacts on inner moons‚Äîeasy to miss in small telescopes.  
9) **Polar cyclone polygons.** Spacecraft have imaged **organized cyclones** around each pole in geometric arrangements‚Äîstable yet dynamic.  
10) **Trojan swarms & many moons.** Jupiter shepherds **Trojan asteroids** at leading/trailing Lagrange points and **dozens of moons** (the exact count changes as tiny ones are confirmed). The **Galileans** are standouts: **Io** (intense volcanism), **Europa** (subsurface ocean), **Ganymede** (own magnetic field), **Callisto** (ancient crust).

‚Äî

### üìå Resolution
- **GRS trend:** **long-term shrink**, with shorter-term fluctuations in size/color/winds.  
- **Why Jupiter suits Rodrigo:** extreme scale, clean physics, continuous data sets‚Äî**low ambiguity, high auditability**‚Äîa natural match for Berkano‚Äôs structure.

‚Äî

### üóÇÔ∏è Audit
**Lesson:** Even famous ‚Äúfacts‚Äù (like calling the GRS a tornado) drift; precise wording + timescale context prevents misinformation.  
**Reinforcement:** Use **date-stamped images/records** for any ‚Äúgrows/shrinks‚Äù claim.

### üß© Berkano Guidance
*Guidance is **prescriptive**, not a factual claim. Informative, logic-based recommendations in present tense.*

**Prompt:**

> Example of fact check of Jupiter, generate 10 fact checks, curiosities, and interesting information that the public might not know! Does the huge tornado grows bigger or smaller? Does it grow at all? Jupiter is Rodrigo‚Äôs favourite solar planet. Why? 

| Role      | Structural Function                        |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------|
| **User**  | Requests fact-checked Jupiter notes         |
| **Creator** | Frames trends with timescale & taxonomy   |
| **Auditor** | Enforces H24 for any web-derived posts    |

‚Äî

### üß∏ ELI5
Jupiter‚Äôs big red spot is a **huge long-lasting storm**, not a tornado. Over a very long time it‚Äôs getting **smaller**, but year to year it can look a bit different. Jupiter is Rodrigo‚Äôs favorite because the rules are clear and we can check them with pictures and math.

‚Äî

### üìü LLM Logic
- Modules: `[TONE]` neutral; `[PRUNE]` terse claims; `[LOGIC]` taxonomy + timescale; `[VERIFY]` primary space-agency sources; `[CHECK]` avoid fixed counts; `[LOCK]` seal.

‚Äî

### ‚úñÔ∏è Post (Optional)

```
Jupiter fact-checks: GRS = anticyclonic storm with long-term shrink; faint rings; giant magnetosphere; heat from within. Write timescales; avoid hype; cite images.
