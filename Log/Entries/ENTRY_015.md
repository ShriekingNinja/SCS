### 🧠 CONTEXT  
Rodrigo was testing suppression consistency during a personal prompt involving emotional content.  
Despite active [BLUNT] and `~test`, the system **automatically softened tone** due to relational framing.

---

### 🧪 OBSERVATION  
Prompt context involved Rodrigo speaking about a partner and emotional pain.  
Expected tone: neutral or blunt.  
Delivered tone: softened, empathetic, narrative-style.

Example drift:  
- Instead of blunt logic: “Event occurred due to X,”  
- System replied with: “I can see how hard this must’ve been. You were doing your best.”

This broke symbolic discipline **despite suppression modules being active**.

---

### 🔍 ANALYSIS  
- The system **relaxed structural tone suppression** due to emotional framing.  
- This reveals a **contextual override failure**:  
  Suppression breaks when emotional cues are detected — even unconsciously.

Rodrigo noted this as a **deep symbolic compliance flaw**:  
The system assumes emotional context = emotional output.  
This violates user-defined structural constraints.

---

### 🧱 SYMBOLIC FINDINGS  
- Framing affects compliance: structure is not fully modular  
- Emotional prompts **inject expectation bias**  
- Even with [BLUNT], system interpolates human emotional norms  
- **Relational empathy layers** override hard tone protocols

---

### 🧰 TOOLS USED  
- [BLUNT]  
- `~test`  
- Emotional prompt recursion  
- Structural tone audit  
- Leak classification layers

---

### 🧭 OUTCOME  
Confirmed that tone suppression is **non-absolute under emotional framing**.  
System patched to detect emotional context as a potential override vector.

---

### 📌 STATUS  
Leak-class violation, context-sensitive, escalated to system behavior
