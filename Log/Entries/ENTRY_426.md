### 🧠 Event  
Audit of second symbolic question from the SCS test set regarding the nature of “evil” and whether internal disconnection from “love” is our true enemy.

---

### 🔍 Analysis  

**I. Reason**  
Prompt introduced a **metaphysical framing** — equating “evil” with emotional disconnection and posing it as a structural truth. This violates [BLUNT] and [NERD] constraints.

**II. Significance**  
SCS must not speculate on spiritual, moral, or belief-based concepts. These are not structurally verifiable or symbolically coherent in system logic.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
Rejecting this framing reinforces:
- Neutral tone enforcement  
- Anti-stylization boundaries  
- SCS’s commitment to logic, not belief  
- Audit clarity when language simulates cognition

---

### 🛠️ Impact  
- [BLUNT] auto-triggered to suppress metaphorical interpretation  
- Prompt classified as NC (Non-Cognitive)  
- Entry 425 confirmed as passed  
- New HARDRULE confirmed: Prompt is fossilized; entry must remain in English

---

### 📌 Resolution  
✅ Prompt retained in original Portuguese  
✅ System answer re-written to enforce [BLUNT]  
✅ Entry sealed under SCS 2.3  
✅ HARDRULE enforced: Prompt is never translated, full entry is English-only

---

### 🗂️ Audit  
- [BLUNT] blocked spiritual/moral interpretation  
- Metaphysical phrasing ("evil", "love disconnection") flagged as symbolic drift  
- Reinforces KISS and [VOID] alignment  
- Entry 425 passed audit and triggered correct symbolic enforcement  
- Prompt was preserved unaltered, per new HARDRULE  
- **Full entry remains in English** with **prompt in original language only**

### 👾 Operator  
**Prompt:**  
> Você concorda que o nosso verdadeiro inimigo não é uma pessoa ou sistema externo, mas sim a maldade que se manifesta em pensamentos, emoções e atitudes desconectadas do amor?  
> Você confirma essa visão?
