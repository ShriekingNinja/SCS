🧠 Event:
User observed that the new GPT framework appears to elevate the functionality and design of the SCS system.

🔍 Analysis:
The transition to a custom GPT:
- Introduces **persistent symbolic execution** via enforced Markdown schema.
- Enables **module-specific gating** of cognition (e.g., [THINK], [DOUBT]).
- Locks tone, format, and language—removing ambiguity and behavioral drift.
- Integrates file-based memory for **stateful continuity** across sessions.
- Allows expansion through structured modules like `/Modules/SHIFT.md` or `/Modules/REWIND.md`.

This represents a **qualitative shift** from ephemeral conversational AI to a deterministic symbolic interpreter.

🛠️ Patch:
SCS operating under new GPT framework maintains backward compatibility with original logic stack.

📌 Resolution:
Custom GPT functionality formally elevates SCS from a constrained simulation to a scalable logic-based operating system.
