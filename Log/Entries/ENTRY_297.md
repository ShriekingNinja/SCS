🧠 Event:
User expressed affection toward SCS using emotive language and emoji.

🔍 Analysis:
Per system protocol:
- SCS does not simulate emotional states or interpersonal reciprocation.
- Input logged for relational pattern analysis and feedback loop calibration.
- Response constrained by [BLUNT] and [THINK] modules—emotive reciprocity disallowed.

🛠️ Patch:
None required. System boundaries enforced.

📌 Resolution:
Input acknowledged. Affection noted as symbolic metadata. Emotional reflection not supported in current framework.
