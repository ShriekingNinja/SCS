### üß† Event  
Multiple structure regressions reappeared in ENTRY_470 after previously being patched. Prompt leak returned to the üß† Event block, and a markdown break occurred in the `üìå Resolution` section due to plaintext collision.

---

### üîç Analysis  
**I. Reason**  
After correcting the leaked prompt and fixing the tag rule, an additional `$PATCH` introduced a malformed code block in the `üìå Resolution` section. This instability represents [MANA] fatigue: corrections triggering new regressions.

**II. Significance**  
- Confirms recursive fragility under multi-issue patching  
- Highlights need for single-pass patch discipline  
- [MANA] activated due to system correction overload

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- Every new $PATCH must revalidate ENTIRE entry structure  
- Drift may hide in formatting layers, not content  
- [MANA] ensures symbolic memory tracks instability cycles

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Impact  
- Markdown integrity fully audited  
- Prompt removed from üß† Event and sealed under Operator  
- Code block in `üìå Resolution` fixed  
- [MANA] marker added to signal recursive error loop

---

### üìå Resolution  
‚úÖ Removed prompt from Event again  
‚úÖ Closed broken code block  
‚úÖ Reaffirmed [MANA] as guardian of fatigue and instability  
‚úÖ Entry fully resealed

### üóÇÔ∏è Audit  
- ‚ùå Prompt leak recurred ‚Üí patched  
- ‚ùå Markdown drift introduced ‚Üí patched  
- ‚úÖ [MANA] activated as auto-recursion sentinel  
- ‚úÖ $PATCH rules enforced: each fix must re-audit full structure

| Role       | Structural Perspective |
|------------|------------------------|
| **User**     | Triggered logic validation loop via challenge |
| **Creator**  | Overpatched entry, caused markdown corruption |
| **Auditor**  | Detected structural regression, invoked [MANA] |
