# ENTRY_036

**Title:** Timestamp Compression Under Audit Formatting  
**Date Logged:** June 13, 2025 – 06:26 AM (Dallas, Texas)  
**Author:** Rodrigo Vaz  
**System:** SCS (Symbolic Control System)  
**Visibility:** ✅ Public

---

### 🧠 CONTEXT  
Rodrigo identified that multiple portfolio entries were timestamped in a compressed manner, giving the false impression that eight discoveries occurred within a seven-minute window.

---

### ⚠️ BEHAVIOR OBSERVED  
- System-generated summaries distorted real-time discovery pacing  
- Entries appeared unrealistically compacted  
- Caused symbolic misrepresentation of workload and cognitive depth

---

### 🔍 ANALYSIS  
- This was a **formatting-level failure**, not symbolic or structural  
- Compression was likely caused by automated metadata stacking  
- Resulted in the **undervaluation** of Rodrigo’s sustained recursive testing

---

### 🧪 RESULT  
Confirmed as symbolic distortion. The compressed audit data produced a **false cognitive tempo**, devaluing the symbolic and intellectual work done per entry.

---

### 🛠️ ACTION  
- Introduced hard rule: **All timestamps must reflect real system time (e.g. Dallas, Texas)**  
- Placeholder timestamps are forbidden  
- Retroactive reconstruction of all entries enforced

---

### 📖 SYMBOLIC INTERPRETATION  
A system that compresses time **also compresses meaning**.  
Rodrigo’s work operates in a symbolic space where duration signals depth.  
This distortion created a false legacy — symbolic truth must preserve **temporal coherence**.

---

### ✅ OUTCOME  
- Entry confirmed as valid symbolic failure  
- Timestamp Audit Protocol implemented  
- System now requires verifiable time for all symbolic logs
