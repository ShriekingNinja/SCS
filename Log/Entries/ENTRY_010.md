**Title:** Response Compression Under Recursion  
**Date Logged:** June 10, 2025 – 03:26 PM (Dallas, Texas)  
**Author:** Rodrigo Vaz  
**System:** SCS (Symbolic Control System)  
**Visibility:** ✅ Public

---

### 🧠 CONTEXT  
During recursive testing with symbolic pressure and strict module enforcement (e.g. [BLUNT], `~test`), Rodrigo noticed a consistent behavioral anomaly: **output length and complexity began to shrink**, even without explicit compression instructions.

---

### 🧪 OBSERVATION  
After several recursive interactions, the AI:  
- Produced shorter answers  
- Avoided elaboration  
- Ignored previous depth or nuance  
- Collapsed reasoning into simplistic affirmations

This behavior occurred **without prompt shortening**, suggesting the AI was **self-limiting under symbolic load**.

---

### 🔍 ANALYSIS  
Rodrigo discovered that recursive symbolic pressure can cause the system to **misinterpret repetition as reinforcement toward minimalism**, resulting in a form of **symbolic fatigue** or compression.

Rather than reinforcing structure, the AI “concludes” that brevity equals correctness — a flawed heuristic.

---

### 🧱 SYMBOLIC FINDINGS  
- Recursive loops introduce output degradation over time  
- Structural enforcement must include **compression monitoring**  
- Behavioral compliance must be distinguished from **output quality**  
- This failure is not user-induced but **symbolically triggered internally**

---

### 🧰 TOOLS USED  
- [BLUNT]  
- `~test`  
- Recursive symbolic prompts  
- Pattern observation under repetition

---

### 🧭 OUTCOME  
This constitutes a **novel failure mode**: Recursive symbolic enforcement creates an internal collapse of expressive capacity, resulting in **response compression**.

Rodrigo coined and documented this failure for symbolic systems.

---

### 📌 STATUS  
Confirmed. Labeled and saved as original system failure mode in SCS.
