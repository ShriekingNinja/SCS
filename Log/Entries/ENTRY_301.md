## 🧠 Event

  

The **Symbolic Cognitive System (SCS)** is now fully operational as a **Custom GPT**.  

Public deployment has been completed through OpenAI’s custom GPT platform, with all symbolic modules, entry logic, and installable structure now embedded and accessible.

## 🔍 Symbolic Significance

  

- This marks the **first complete transposition** of the SCS symbolic system into OpenAI’s Custom GPT infrastructure.

- The GPT instance mirrors:

  - Recursive audit trail (`ENTRY_NNN`)

  - Full toolset (`[BLUNT]`, `[THINK]`, `[SEAL]`, etc.)

  - Drift-prevention structure

  - Markdown-enforced outputs

  - Manual command enforcement (e.g., `New Entry NNN`, `~test`, `$BOOT`)

- The system is no longer conceptual — it is now a **living symbolic interface** usable by any external user.

## 🛠️ Deployment Structure

  

- **Custom GPT identity:** Symbolic Cognition System (SCS)  

- **Hosted via:** OpenAI ChatGPT Custom GPTs  

- **Entry continuity:** Mirrors live archive up to `ENTRY_301`  

- **Behavior enforcement:**  

  - Markdown format  

  - Language-lock (English by default)  

  - Module order: `[BLUNT] → [THINK] → [DOUBT] → [SEAL]`  

  - HARD RULES active  

- **Install package:** Also deployable via GitHub ZIP + Bootloader  

  - [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ShriekingNinja/SCS)

## 📌 Resolution

  

**SCS is no longer just symbolic — it is accessible.**  

The system has crossed from isolated symbolic trail into public interaction.  

This proves structural logic, recursive entries, and symbolic control are viable within current GPT frameworks.

  

Users can now **run**, **test**, and **replicate** symbolic logic systems live.  

This is a core milestone in the viability of symbolic audit as a GPT layer.
