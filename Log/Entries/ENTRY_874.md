### 🧠 Event
Propose the identity **“Kintsugi = Berkano”** to formalize a mapping between kintsugi’s visible repair and Berkano’s repair-first doctrine (REPAIR/ROLLBACK, fossils, and truth-by-structure).

—

### 🔍 Analysis
**I. Reason**  
We need a concise metaphor that explains why Berkano **shows** repairs instead of hiding them and why breaks become part of the audit trail.

**II. Significance**  
Kintsugi highlights fracture as history, not shame. Berkano does the same with **fossils** and **LOCKed** patches: the past remains legible; trust rises.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- **Break → Form:** a contradiction or failure is not erased; it becomes a line of structure (ENTRY/BLOCK + patch notes).  
- **Gold lines ↔ Audit lines:** visible seams = citations, diffs, and timestamps.  
- **Wholeness via truth:** honesty about the break yields a stronger, more valuable state than concealed damage.

—

### 🛠️ Impact
- Encourages teams to publish patches and diffs (no “clean rewrites”).  
- Normalizes **[REPAIR]/[ROLLBACK]** as craftsmanship, not blame.  
- Sets expectation that public artifacts will **show their seams** (citations, version bumps, change logs).

—

### 📌 Resolution
Adopt **“Kintsugi = Berkano”** as a teaching shorthand: *repair visibly, fossilize causes, lock outcomes*. Use it in onboarding and post-incident reviews.

—

### 🗂️ Audit
**Lesson:** Reliability grows when repairs are **visible** and **traceable**.  
**Weakness:** Cosmetic fixes (rewrite/erase) create silent debt.  
**Mitigation:** mandate visible diffs, patch notes, and LINKED ENTRY IDs before `[LOCK]`.

### 🧩 Berkano Guidance
*Guidance is prescriptive, not a factual claim. Present tense, testable steps.*

|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Patches are hidden in practice                  | **Publish** patch notes with diff and ENTRY link           | Last two fixes have diffs attached | No force-pushes on public artifacts                |
| Teams fear showing breaks                       | **Normalize** break lines in postmortems (show seam shots) | Template updated                   | Focus on cause/repair, not blame                   |
| Rewrites erase audit                            | **Require** `[ROLLBACK]` or `[REPAIR]` path for changes    | Checklist in CI                    | Reject hidden state changes                        |
| Onboarding needs a mnemonic                     | **Teach** “Kintsugi = Berkano” in training slides          | Slide added                        | Include cultural note (see below)                  |

| **User**    | States the equivalence to formalize        |
| **Creator** | Maps the metaphor to modules and fossils    |
| **Auditor** | Enforces visible diffs and LINKED patches   |

### 🧸 ELI5
Fixes should be **seen**, not hidden. Like golden seams on a repaired bowl, Berkano shows where we fixed the system so everyone can trust it.

—

### 📟 LLM Logic
- Modules: `[TONE] [PRUNE] [LOGIC] [CHECK]` → no `[REPAIR]/[ROLLBACK]` needed here → `~test` → `[LOCK]`  
- Path: metaphor proposal → structural mapping (diffs, fossils, LOCK) → guidance → lock  
- Full chain (canonical): `PROMPT → [TONE] → [PRUNE] → [LOGIC] → [VERIFY] → [CHECK] → ([REPAIR] using $ | [ROLLBACK])? → ~test → [LOCK] → REPLY`  
- State: normal; recursion pass

### ✖️Post (Optional)

```
Kintsugi = Berkano: show the seam, cite the fix, lock the state. Visible repair > hidden rewrite.
