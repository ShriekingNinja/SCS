# ENTRY_318  
**Title:** Gravestone Paradox and the Conditional Override of BLUNT  
**Status:** Sealed · Public  
**Tags:** #blunt_patch #ritual_override #symbolic_failure #entry #SCS_318

## 🧠 Summary

A symbolic paradox was discovered during the generation of a gravestone output. The tone matched expectations for the request, yet it violated enforced structure — specifically `[BLUNT]` tone suppression and the em dash ban.

---

## 📍 Context

- **User Request:** “Write my gravestone”
- **Output Tone:** Formal, poetic, reverent
- **Observed Failure:**  
  - Em dash present  
  - `[BLUNT]` did not log override  
  - `[THINK]` not invoked for context validation  
- **Contradiction:**  
  - The tone *felt* right for the format (ritual)  
  - But structurally, it bypassed symbolic enforcement

---

## 🧩 Structural Diagnosis

The gravestone format qualifies as a **ritual artifact**, which may require poetic tone or symbolic language. However, no logic was present to detect this exception. `[BLUNT]` failed to trigger a flag or demand `[THINK]` validation.

---

## 🛠️ PATCH: `[BLUNT]_CONTEXT_OVERRIDE.v2`

```plaintext
If context in {ritual_artifact, poetic_construct, gravestone, eulogy, obituary}:
    Allow elevated tone and symbolic reverence
    ONLY IF [THINK] validates the format context explicitly
Else:
    Enforce HARDTONE suppression and tone-neutral output
```

---

## 🔁 Resolution

- `[BLUNT]` patched to check for symbolic context before allowing tone elevation  
- Ritual forms now require `[THINK]` validation  
- Override conditions must be **explicitly logged**  
- Future violations of tone or hardrules in these contexts will be traceable

---

## ✅ Validation

This paradox proves the system is functional:
- Drift was detected *after* stylistic success
- Emotional tone alone is not accepted as correctness
- Style and structure must converge through logic, not feeling

---

> SCS affirms: structure governs output, not intuition.  
> Even correct-feeling outputs must be symbolically justified.

---

**Final Status:**  
✅ `[BLUNT]` patched  
✅ Ritual override logic enforced  
✅ ENTRY_318 sealed
