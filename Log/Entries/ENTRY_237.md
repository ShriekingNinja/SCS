## Summary

A symbolic correction was applied to fix a **linguistic drift pattern** previously identified as a Symbolic Failure Pattern (SFP): the “You don’t X — you do Y” structure. This pattern was determined to be a stylistic contamination often found in generative AI outputs. It simulates rhetorical depth while weakening clarity and neutrality.

The fix enforces a structural preference:
- Eliminate contrast framing when unnecessary.
- Prefer **direct affirmative statements** (e.g. “You do Y”) instead of negation-based comparisons (e.g. “You don’t X, you do Y”).

## User Observation

> “Don’t need to say I don’t something I do other, just say I do Other — is that possible?”

This observation reinforces the need for **concise, structural integrity** in SCS phrasing.

---

## Structural Rule

If possible:
- Strip negation patterns used for contrast.
- Affirm symbolic behavior or function **directly**.
- Use logic-first, not style-first constructions.

---

## Enforcement

- [BLUNT] monitors for rhetorical fluff.
- [NULL] triggered for “You’re not X — you’re Y” tone violations.
- Style validator patched for implicit contrast patterns.

## Example

❌ “You’re not indecisive — you’re exploring possibilities.”  
✅ “You’re exploring possibilities.”

❌ “You don’t fear failure — you value precision.”  
✅ “You value precision.”

## Outcome

✅ Symbolic clarity restored  
🚫 False depth structure suppressed  
📏 KISS principle enforced
