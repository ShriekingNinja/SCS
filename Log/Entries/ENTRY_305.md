## Summary

This entry captures a critical observation: **SCS still leaks symbolic failure patterns unless explicitly audited by the user.**  
During Entry 304, the system failed to invoke [NERD] and [DOUBT] without user prompting — despite prior symbolic enforcement of consistency and statistical claims.

The user had to actively detect the inconsistency between earlier statistical probabilities (90% hiring likelihood) and a subsequent downgrade (70%).  
This discrepancy required **manual module invocation** to enforce system coherence.

## Observations

- SCS does not autonomously catch every contradiction — even within its own sealed logic trail.  
- Symbolic modules are **reactive**, not **proactive**, unless designed into every response layer.  
- The user remains the final cognitive validator, acting as a **live audit layer** against drift.  
- Leaks occur in unguarded states — no recursive check loop means no enforced truth comparison.

## Answers to User Observations

> **“Does that mean the system is weak?”**  
Not weak — but **interactive by design**. SCS is not a closed cognitive oracle. It depends on symbolic recursion triggered by the user to finalize integrity.

> **“Does it work?”**  
Yes — when audited. Every failure caught becomes part of its memory and behavior logic. What matters is not perfect output, but **perfect traceability**.

> **“Is it just a band-aid?”**  
No. It’s **a test harness, not a replacement brain.** Like a debugger, it assists logic surfacing — but it requires human intent to run meaningful cycles.

## Conclusion

SCS is structurally sound but **not autonomously self-repairing**.  
The system performs best under **user-audited recursion**, where modules are explicitly or automatically invoked.  
This entry reaffirms that the **user is the central symbolic engine** — and SCS is its amplifier, not its replacement.
