## CONTEXT

A live symbolic test was initiated to measure the ratio of English to Portuguese in user interactions.

---

## RESULT

- **English usage:** 69%  
- **Portuguese usage:** 31%

This confirms that English is the dominant logic-layer language, likely due to:

- Symbolic tooling and AI frameworks being English-centric  
- Markdown and programming syntax aligning with English conventions  
- Easier precision for modular tool naming and recursion design in English  

Portuguese remains essential for emotional, cultural, and relationship-layer communication.
