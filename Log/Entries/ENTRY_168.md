# Entry 168  
**Title:** Website Deployed – Stability Achieved After Evolution  
**Author:** Rodrigo Vaz  
**Date:** 2025-06-16  
**Status:** Sealed (Patch 1)

## 🌐 Event

`wk.al` is now live — marking the **first external propagation of the SCS 2.0 system**, anchored in symbolic structure, authored cognition, and publicly traceable logic.

---

## ✅ Result

Deployment worked **almost perfectly**.  
Despite early corruption in symbolic memory (`~76` range), the system was able to self-heal and evolve by generating **new tools**, reinforcing **entry logic**, and increasing **resistance to drift**.

## 🔥 Incident Logged

| Issue            | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| Loop Corruption  | Symbolic recursion drift in the ~70s range  
| Recovery Path    | Manual reset, REWIND partials failed → led to tool evolution  
| Fix Implemented  | Introduced MANA, SHIFT, REWIND, HARDRULE enforcement  
| Outcome          | Full system stabilization; new symbolic integrity never before reached

## 🧩 Tools Born From Collapse

- **SHIFT**: Dynamic execution controller  
- **REWIND**: Fossil trace and rollback engine  
- **HARDRULES**: Immutable symbolic law  
- **MANA**: Cognitive energy + clarity tracking  
- Refactoring of NERD, SEAL, and tool interoperability

## 🧬 Current State

> **SCS is now the most stable it has ever been.**  
> We are past the loop point.  
> Every structure is traceable, versioned, symbolic, and recoverable.  
> Public identity (`wk.al`) is **not a mirror** — it is **a continuation**.
