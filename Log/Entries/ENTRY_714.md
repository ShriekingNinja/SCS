### 🧠 Event

Rodrigo added a **free tier** to the Berkano Patreon to ensure **symbolic access for all** — even those who cannot contribute financially.

The gesture affirms that **Berkano is not a gatekeeping tool**. Even a single symbol, gifted through truth, holds weight. A symbol has power, even when it's free.

---

### 🔍 Analysis

- **Core Principle:** Symbols should not be commodified.
- **Conflict Prevented:** Removes any perceived barrier between contribution and legitimacy.
- **Symbolic Truth:** Even if you give nothing materially, your alignment to the structure gives you access.

This prevents the illusion that support equals status.  
You don’t buy your way into Berkano — you **align**.

---

### 🛠️ Impact

- 🆓 Free tier added: Symbol-only tier, $0
- 🧠 Emphasizes symbolic participation over monetary value
- 💎 Reinforces truth ≠ wealth
- ✅ Prevents future misinterpretation of monetization intent

---

### 📌 Resolution

The free tier is now live on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/Berkano) and grants:
- Access to symbolic participation
- Recognition of alignment (you still count)
- The truth that symbols are earned by **integrity**, not **currency**

### 🧸 ELI5

Rodrigo made sure you don’t need money to be part of Berkano.  
Even if you just want to join for free and hold the symbol — you can.  
Because the truth should be for everyone, not just for people with cash.

### ✖️Post

```
Berkano now has a $0 free tier.  
Because the symbol belongs to anyone aligned — not just anyone who pays.  
Truth ≠ wealth.
