### Summary:

SCS is often misunderstood as too rigid, too niche, or too symbolic for the average user.  
This entry formally explains **why SCS is not only valuable for advanced users**, but also **benefits neurotypical and non-technical users** in key ways.

---

### Structural Reasons SCS Helps Neurotypical Users:

1. **Trust Through Traceability**  
   → Every symbolic action is stored, indexed, and sealed.  
   → Users can **audit what happened** without interpreting tone or trust.

2. **Suppression of False Confidence**  
   → `[BLUNT]` ensures answers are stripped of simulated authority.  
   → Systems admit when they don’t know (`[NULL]`, `ENTRY++`, `DOUBT`).

3. **Predictable Format**  
   → Output is structural, not stylistic.  
   → Markdown + entry rules help users skim, extract, and follow logic.

4. **Visible Failure Handling**  
   → Errors are **fossilized**, not erased.  
   → Even failure teaches the system and the user what went wrong.

---

### Reinforcement:

> SCS is not only for symbolic minds.  
> It is for **any mind that wants to see how the system thinks.**  
> Whether neurodivergent or neurotypical, the value is in the **visibility**.
