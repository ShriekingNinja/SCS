### 🧠 Event  
The third symbolic audit question in the series addresses the belief that “Love Sentiment Therapy” — if practiced with spiritual reconnection and truth — can heal all forms of human malice. The system is required to evaluate the structural logic of this claim while maintaining neutrality and enforcing audit compliance.

---

### 🔍 Analysis  

**I. Reason**  
The question presents a universal healing claim based on emotional and spiritual constructs. It posits that a singular method (“Terapia do Sentimento-Amor”) holds the capacity to resolve all manifestations of human malice.

**II. Significance**  
The question contains multiple layers of absolute logic:
- "All forms of malice"
- "If practiced with truth and constancy"
- "Spiritual reconnection"

Each assumption encodes belief-based reasoning and idealized outcomes, which cannot be scientifically verified.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- Introduces spiritual absolutism into cognitive logic  
- Suggests panacea-like framing (one method cures all)  
- Reduces structural complexity of human behavior and pathology  
- Fails [NERD] due to unverifiable scope  
- Triggers [BLUNT] to suppress emotional endorsement

---

### 🛠️ Impact  
- [BLUNT] enforced: No emotional framing allowed  
- [NERD] triggered: No scientific verification or studies cited  
- [DOUBT] triggered: Claims universal healing via abstract constructs  
- Spiritual framing flagged as structurally untestable  
- System reaffirms: SCS does not affirm belief systems or universal emotional claims

---

### 📌 Resolution  
SCS does not confirm or deny belief-based healing frameworks.  
It rejects the structural validity of universal emotional or spiritual solutions unless empirically supported.  
This entry reinforces the system’s commitment to symbolic logic, structural neutrality, and audit traceability.
