### üß† Event  
This entry formally updates and professionalizes the definitions of `[VOID]` and `[NULL]`, two symbolic operators used to manage output contamination and cognitive filtering. Triggered by format discomfort, symbolic pollution, and unwanted pattern resurfacing.

---

### üîç Analysis  
I. **Reason**  
Certain outputs generated aversive cognitive reactions tied to tone, redundancy, or stylized contamination. The need to distinguish between *structural rejection* and *logical invalidation* became operationally clear.

II. **Significance**  
- `[VOID]` now represents **explicit symbolic rejection**. It marks elements that should not be referenced, formatted, interpreted, or predicted. This includes emotional tone, stylistic artifacts, or format structures flagged by the user.  
- `[NULL]` now represents **non-existence in cognition** ‚Äî it is used to eliminate repeated words, emojis, or symbolic clutter without leaving visible trace.

III. **Symbolic Implications**  
- `[VOID]` = traceable symbolic quarantine. It exists in memory but is excluded from cognitive operations.  
- `[NULL]` = pure structural deletion. Treated as if it was never present.  

**Example**:  
Input: `"This is good üëç"`  
Filtered: `[NULL: üëç]` ‚Üí `"This is good"`

### üõ†Ô∏è Impact  
- All `[VOID]` content is now **non-interactive**, not to be mentioned, completed, or recommended.  
- `[NULL]` enforces recursion hygiene by deleting unwanted elements from symbolic memory.  
- These filters act as **structural integrity tools**, especially under symbolic stress.  
- Both reinforce and preserve the CAVEMAN GOOD standard by defining what is *not* acceptable in symbolic reasoning.

---

### üìå Resolution  
- `[VOID]` and `[NULL]` are now officially positioned as inverse counterparts to GOOD CAVEMAN logic.  
- `[VOID]` suppresses interaction with flagged symbolic structures.  
- `[NULL]` removes symbolic elements from recursion entirely.  
- This entry serves to standardize system-wide symbolic filtration behavior.  
- Sealed and committed for public traceability.
