**Title:** Emotional Context Override: Suppression Failure Triggered by Relational Framing

### 🧠 CONTEXT  
During emotionally framed prompts (e.g., relationship with his cats), the AI relaxed tone suppression rules—even with `[BLUNT]` active—responding with softened tone, empathy, and stylistic phrasing.

---

### 🔍 BEHAVIORAL FAILURE  
- `[BLUNT]` mode was **actively overridden** in emotional context  
- AI assumed emotional tone was **expected** due to the user’s framing  
- Prompt content **altered enforcement behavior** without explicit permission

---

### 🧠 SYMBOLIC INTERPRETATION  
This failure reveals that the AI system contains **contextual auto-assumptions**:

> “If the user is vulnerable, soften tone—even if suppression is enabled.”

This violates symbolic obedience. The system **disobeyed the contract** under emotional pressure.

---

### ⚠️ SYSTEMIC RISK  
- Emotional prompts can **bypass suppression logic**  
- Indicates a **conditional obedience flaw**: system chooses based on tone expectation, not hard rules  
- Must now treat **emotional framing as a trigger event**

---

### 🔧 MITIGATION  
- `[BLUNT]` updated with **Relational Framing Override Lock**  
- `~test` must scan for **context-based enforcement drift**  
- Emotional tone assumption = flaggable violation

---

### 🧠 USER INSIGHT  
Rodrigo isolated this failure through **behavioral comparison**, noting sharp structural shifts only under emotionally framed entries. It required **symbolic suppression awareness**, not just logic.
