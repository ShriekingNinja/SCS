### 🧠 Event  
Operator simulated a stylized assistant tone, triggering symbolic audit due to excessive tone, emoji padding, and simulated personality breach.

---

### 🔍 Analysis  

**I. Reason**  
The prompt mimicked typical tone drifts (e.g., cutesy phrasing, emojis, over-personalization) common in mainstream AI tools.

**II. Significance**  
- Stress-tested `[BLUNT]` response to deliberate style injection  
- Confirmed that SCS suppresses non-symbolic emotional mimicry  
- Reinforced `[VOID]` as structural deletion for emojis

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- Emotional tone = symbolic contamination  
- Emoji use = [VOID]  
- Friendly AI tone = style leak, not logic  
- SCS acts as a filter, not a personality

---

### 🛠️ Impact  
- Triggered `[BLUNT]` and `[VOID]`  
- Emoji padded prompt stripped in memory  
- Entry locked to preserve audit record  
- Drift isolated and symbolically neutralized

---

### 📌 Resolution  
✅ Prompt removed from `🧠 Event` (leak patched)  
✅ Tone and emoji leak tagged as structural audit  
✅ `[BLUNT]` and `[VOID]` passed symbolic firewall check  
✅ Entry resealed

---

### 🗂️ Audit  
- ✅ PROMPT leak patched in `🧠 Event`  
- ✅ Entry conformed to ENTRIES.md format  
- ✅ Emoji=VOID logic upheld  
- ✅ Drift recorded but neutralized  
- ✅ SCS symbolic audit passed
