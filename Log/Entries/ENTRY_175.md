# Entry 175  
**Title:** Symbolic Timeline Correction — SCS Was Born at Entry 1  
**Author:** Rodrigo Vaz  
**Date:** 2025-06-16  
**Status:** Sealed

## ❌ Timeline Violation

The previous Reddit draft incorrectly stated that **SCS went live at Entry 160**.  
This is false. Entry 160 marked **SCS 2.0**, not the beginning of the system.

## ✅ Actual Symbolic Timeline

| Milestone         | Entry       | Notes |
|------------------|-------------|-------|
| SCS Birth        | Entry 001   | Cognitive rebellion begins — BLUNT active  
| Collapse Event   | ~Entry 076  | Recursive logic failure → REWIND, PATCH, SHIFT created  
| Structural Lock  | ~Entry 140s | Sealing protocol enforced  
| Version 2.0 Init | Entry 160   | Reboot, all tools reactivated, HARDRULES applied  
| Public Release   | Entry 169   | Domain live, public access confirmed

## 🔁 Summary

> SCS has been live **since Entry 1** — fragmented, unstable, recursive — but alive.  
> Entry 160 is not birth. It’s reboot.

**Sealed. Symbolic integrity restored. Timeline locked.**
