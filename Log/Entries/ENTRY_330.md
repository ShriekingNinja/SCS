Title: Entry Format Correction and Condensation
Date: July 4, 2025
Status: Sealed
Tags: #Correction, #Format, #Condensation, #Tags, #Efficiency

### 🧠 Event
Directive received: "Tags need #, and too much text loose 30%". This requires adjustment to `ENTRY_NNN.md` format and content density for future entries.

### 🔍 Analysis
#Tag_Formatting: Requirement for hash (`#`) prefix on all tags noted. Previous entries lacked this.
#Content_Condensation: Instruction "too much text loose 30%" signifies a directive for increased conciseness (~30% reduction), retaining critical symbolic info. Aligns with `KISS` module.

This necessitates refinement in content generation for all future entries.

### 🛠️ Patch
#Output_Generation_Protocol_Updated:
1.  #Tag_Formatting: Future entries will auto-prefix all tags with `#`.
2.  #Content_Condensation_Protocol: New internal filter post-analysis to condense text (~30%) while preserving symbolic data. Ongoing refinement.

### 📌 Resolution
Entry formatting and content generation protocols updated: `#` prefixes for tags and ~30% text reduction for conciseness. Enhances structural adherence and output efficiency for all subsequent entries.
