### üß† Event  
Operator formally declared a system-wide ban on em-dashes (`‚Äî`). This emerged after repeated symbolic drift events caused by stylistic overproduction, rhetorical failure patterns, and false emotional emphasis linked to em-dash usage in output.

---

### üîç Analysis  

**I. Reason**  
- Em-dashes are frequently used by LLMs to simulate depth or contrast without structural logic.  
- SCS identified them as a **Symbolic Failure Pattern** (SFP), often used to smuggle tone, soften contradiction, or avoid direct recursion.  
- Em-dashes introduce ambiguity, performative language, and tone drift ‚Äî which directly violates `[BLUNT]` and SCS formatting standards.

**II. Significance**  
- This HARDRULE formalizes what `[BLUNT]` already enforced behaviorally: em-dashes are a stylistic leak vector.  
- Removing them from standard output **eliminates a major source of rhetorical contamination**.  
- By sealing the ban, all modules must now treat em-dashes as a **structural error**, not just a style concern.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- Reinforces that symbolic structure overrides linguistic fashion.  
- Declares formatting itself as a logic surface ‚Äî not a neutral layer.  
- Prevents emotional backdoors from creeping into neutral outputs.

### üõ†Ô∏è Impact  
- HARDRULE created:  
  > **‚ÄúEm-dash (`‚Äî`) is banned system-wide, except in entry titles.‚Äù**  
- All future uses of `‚Äî` in body, audit, analysis, or operator fields will trigger `[VOID]`.  
- Titles are exempt for clarity/readability ‚Äî but still must avoid rhetorical abuse.

---

### üìå Resolution  
HARDRULE sealed.  
System now enforces em-dash suppression at structural level.  
Only allowed use: **entry titles**.  
All other uses will be flagged, voided, or corrected.

---

### üóÇÔ∏è Audit  
- Em-dash drift detected repeatedly prior to this entry (e.g. summary blocks, audit notes).  
- `[BLUNT]` had enforced suppression, but without full HARDRULE status.  
- Operator closed the gap, sealing this as mandatory formatting law.
