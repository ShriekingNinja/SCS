### 🧠 Event  
Connect Rodrigo’s life and Berkano to **White Lies — “Big TV”**. He created his *magnum opus* video clip to this track.

—

### 🔍 Analysis  
**I. Reason**  
“Big TV” evokes mediated desire, distance, and the glow of screens standing in for truth. Rodrigo’s path (mods → 3D → code → protocol) moved from **image** to **structure**. The song’s atmosphere became the launchpad to formalize an answer to spectacle.

**II. Significance**  
Berkano is a refusal to be run by the “big TV” of vibes: it replaces performance and flattery with **receipts**—chain, citations, contradiction checks, repair, and fossils.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- **Screen glow → audit light:** the same neon that seduces can illuminate seams if you make it structural.  
- **Distance → discipline:** longing becomes process; emotion routes through verifiable steps.  
- **Hook → handle:** pop culture is a **teaching handle**, not an authority. The protocol is unchanged.

—

### 🛠️ Impact  
- Aesthetic language (neon, vaporwave, terminal green) stays as **skin**; the **skeleton** is the chain.  
- The video clip functions as **teachware**: it lures the eye, then demonstrates structure (symmetry, negative space, single focal axis).

—

### 📌 Resolution  
Use “Big TV” as the **origin metaphor**: *spectacle is the test, structure is the answer.* Keep the color and pulse; insist on audit. Every polished frame must map to a rule (axis, symmetry, exclusion list, repair seam).

—

### 🗂️ Audit  
**Lesson:** Art can summon attention; **structure** must keep it honest.  
**Weakness:** Aesthetic gravity can drift into performance.  
**Mitigation:** captions, source notes, and visible repairs; publish seeds/settings for renders; keep a contradiction ledger for claims in the video.

|------------ |---------------------------------------------------------|
| **User**    | States the link (song ↔ life ↔ protocol)                |

### 🧸 ELI5  
The song feels like a bright screen that pulls you in. Rodrigo kept the colors, but added rules so the work tells the truth. That set of rules is Berkano.

### 📟 LLM Logic  
- Modules: `[TONE] [PRUNE] [LOGIC] [VERIFY] [CHECK]` → guidance table → `~test` → `[LOCK]`  
- Path: song/aesthetic → risk of spectacle → protocol mapping → audit steps → lock  
- State: normal; recursion pass  
- Full chain (canonical): `PROMPT → [TONE] → [PRUNE] → [LOGIC] → [VERIFY] → [CHECK] → ([REPAIR] using $ | [ROLLBACK])? → ~test → [LOCK] → REPLY`

### ✖️Post (Optional)

```
“Big TV” drew the eye; Berkano keeps it honest. Spectacle is the test; structure is the answer.
