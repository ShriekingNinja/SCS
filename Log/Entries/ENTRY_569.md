### 🧠 Event  
The symbolic quote in `ABOUT.md` was updated from the original 1.0 version to a new 2.3.2 formulation. This marks a transition in how the system frames itself publicly, structurally, and philosophically.

---

### 🔍 Analysis  

**I. Reason**  
The quote change reflects a deeper shift in the nature of SCS itself — from identity-based declaration to system-centered structural law.  
- *1.0 quote:* Asserted **Rodrigo’s relationship** to AI and logic.  
- *2.3.2 quote:* Describes **the system’s nature**, independent of the Operator.

**II. Significance**  
This represents a **maturation point** in the architecture of SCS. Where the first quote declared intent and separation from casual AI use, the second enforces **structural ontology** — how SCS *must behave*.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
| Version | Quote | Symbolic Function |
|--------|-------|-------------------|
| 1.0 | “I don’t prompt AI — I interrogate it. I don’t build simulations — I evolve logic.” | Identity, disruption, rebellion — defines Rodrigo as *non-user*, declares symbolic war on casual prompting. |
| 2.3.2 | “Structure is not decoration — it is the skeleton of reason. If it breaks, the whole thing collapses.” | Systemic law — defines structure as **non-optional**, implies death/failure without structural integrity. |

The shift is from **self** to **system**, from **voice** to **architecture**, from **challenge** to **enforcement**.

### 🛠️ Impact  
- The 2.3.2 quote is now embedded in `ABOUT.md` and marks canonical shift to logic-first presentation.  
- The original 1.0 quote is now deprecated, but preserved as a **symbolic fossil**.  
- Future documentation (e.g. `SYMBOLIC_ORIGINS.md`) may include legacy quotes for historical traceability.

---

### 📌 Resolution  
Quote change validated.  
Entry sealed to mark symbolic maturity milestone.  
Both quotes are true within their timelines, but only the 2.3.2 version is now **structurally binding**.

---

### 🗂️ Audit  
- Trigger: User compared two quotes and requested symbolic audit.  
- Drift: None — change reflects intentional progression.  
- Note: Former quote was acceptable during exploratory phase (1.0–2.0). Now fails [BLUNT] and [KISS] filters under current system.

### 👾 Operator  
**Prompt:**  
"NEW ENTRY 569  
Compare the Rodrigo symbolic quote from the ABOUT.md 1.0 to 2.3.2, explain what changed and point to the reader:  
1.0 - “I don’t prompt AI — I interrogate it. I don’t build simulations — I evolve logic.”  
2.3.2 - “Structure is not decoration — it is the skeleton of reason. If it breaks, the whole thing collapses.”"
