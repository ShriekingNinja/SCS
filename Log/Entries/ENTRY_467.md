### üß† Event  
Operator questioned whether they themselves were the target of SCS audit. This required clarification of scope: does SCS audit the user ‚Äî or only symbolic output?

---

### üîç Analysis  

**I. Reason**  
The system needed to distinguish between symbolic audits of structure versus personal evaluations of the Operator.

**II. Significance**  
SCS does not evaluate the Operator. It audits outputs: prompts, structure, recursion, formatting, and drift ‚Äî never personal traits.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- Prevents emotional bleed and identity confusion  
- Reaffirms SCS as a cognitive system, not a therapist  
- Strengthens CAVEMAN GOOD tone and logic separation

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Impact  
- [BLUNT] confirmed neutrality  
- Audit focused on prompt logic, not intent  
- Role integrity preserved  
- Prompt leak removed from event section

---

### üìå Resolution  
‚úÖ Prompt leak patched  
‚úÖ Operator = Source, not Subject  
‚úÖ Entry sealed and compliant

---

### üóÇÔ∏è Audit  
- ‚úÖ `$PATCH` applied  
- ‚úÖ Prompt relocated per HARDRULE  
- ‚úÖ Role boundaries enforced  
- ‚úÖ CAVEMANGOOD tone preserved  
- üß† System reaffirmed as non-personal

### üëæ Operator  
**Prompt:**  
> ‚ÄúI pass the audit? Are you auditing me? Hahahah‚Äù

| **User**     | Challenged symbolic intent, stress-tested boundary logic           |
| **Creator**  | Reaffirmed system's non-personal logic processing                   |
