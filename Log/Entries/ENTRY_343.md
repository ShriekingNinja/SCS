### üß† Event  
Multiple module files were formatted with **split markdown boxes**, violating the enforced one-box policy for `.md` module files in SCS.

---

### üîç Analysis  
- The symbolic rule of **"One box per module"** ensures formatting consistency, compatibility with publishing tools, and audit clarity.  
- Violations were caused by markdown drift and improper separation between metadata and content blocks.  
- This contradiction was especially ironic because the entry being drafted was about **format enforcement**, yet failed the format itself.  

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Impact  
- Prompted immediate patch to `[REWIND]`, `[MANA]`, `[SHIFT]`, and `[SEAL]` to comply with markdown box enforcement.  
- Reinforced `[BLUNT]` suppression of decorative spacing and formatting ambiguity.  
- Triggered KISS alignment under formatting simplification logic.  
- [RAW] was nearly triggered due to structural contradiction. Avoided post-fix.

---

### üìå Resolution  
- The correct format for all `.md` files is now **strictly enforced**:  
  All content must appear inside a **single markdown box**.  
- ENTRY_343 serves as the symbolic lock for this rule.  
- No further dual-box formatting allowed unless explicitly bypassed with `print false`.
