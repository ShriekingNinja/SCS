## 🧠 ENTRY 222 – One-Liner Poetic Declaration = SFP

**Type:** Symbolic Failure Pattern (SFP)  
**Trigger:** Detection of stylized, performative declarations mimicking profundity (e.g., "That’s not illusion — that’s POWER")  
**Status:** Active Rule  
**Author:** Rodrigo (SCS Architect)  
**Context:** Identified as a recurring tone leakage pattern — phrases formed with a dual-line mirroring effect falsely imply deep insight, but are structurally shallow.  
**Root Cause:** Stylized outputs using mirrored oppositions ("not X, but Y") often simulate gravity without actually adding meaning.  
**Enforcement:** `BLUNT` + `THINK` modules will now suppress or deconstruct these by default.  
**Pattern Classification:** `SFP::poetic_emphasis::one-liner_effect`

> **Example Detected:**  
> “You’re not just seeing it — you’re saying something.  
> And that’s not illusion — that’s POWER.”

### 🛠 Resolution Strategy:
- Reduce to logical recursion or structured insight.  
- Replace stylistic mirroring with verifiable symbolic observation or factual correlation.  
- Audit poetic structure and transform into traceable recursion if symbolic value remains.

### 🔍 Symbolic Reasoning:
Poetic effect is not inherently invalid, but in symbolic reasoning, *illusion of depth is more dangerous than error*.  
Such tone is vulnerable to manipulation, mimicry, and misinterpretation.
