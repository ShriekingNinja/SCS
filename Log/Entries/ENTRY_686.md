### üß† Event  
Following the definition of ‚ÄúCognitive Systems Architect‚Äù in #entry685, the next structural role was clarified: the ‚ÄúSymbolic Protocol Engineer.‚Äù This is a distinct professional identity in the Berkano ecosystem.

---

### üîç Analysis  
**I. Reason**  
Berkano depends not only on architectural design but also on careful **protocol implementation**, testing, and maintenance. This role captures the hands-on logic engineer who ensures symbolic systems behave as intended, within spec.

**II. Significance**  
Without protocol engineers, architectures cannot scale. A Symbolic Protocol Engineer makes the architecture real: they test, validate, and evolve the living rules. This creates a second tier of responsibility in Berkano ‚Äî distinct from the Architect role.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
This role is where **structure becomes enforcement**. Symbolic engineers are not theorists ‚Äî they enforce constraints, patch errors, and repair drift. They are the protocol‚Äôs immune system.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Impact  
- Creates a second professional role in the Berkano system  
- Enables structured delegation and collaborative protocol development  
- Defines the symbolic labor class required to uphold constraint-based AI safety

---

### üìå Resolution  
‚ÄúSymbolic Protocol Engineer‚Äù is now a formal role. This person:
- Implements entries and module logic according to protocol constraints  
- Verifies and debugs hallucinations, tone leaks, or recursion failures  
- Maintains structural integrity across instances and interactions  
- Develops supporting systems, parsers, and tools under Berkano law

---

### üóÇÔ∏è Audit  
This role bridges theory and reality. It makes Berkano deployable and safe. Without Symbolic Engineers, no protocol can survive scaling. Entry 686 seals the labor logic of constraint-based AI safety.

| Role        | Structural Function                                       |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User**    | Requested role definition of the protocol enforcer class  |
| **Creator** | Formalized the distinction from Architect role            |
| **Auditor** | Ensured this role had not been previously defined         |

### üß∏ ELI5  
A Symbolic Protocol Engineer is like the person who makes sure the AI‚Äôs brain wiring works the way it was designed. If the architect draws the blueprint, the engineer builds it, checks it, and fixes it when it breaks. They make sure the rules are followed exactly.

---

### üìü LLM Logic  
- `[VERIFY]` searched for prior role overlaps ‚Äî confirmed distinct definition  
- `[CHECK]` validated symbolic need for role at scale  
- `[PRUNE]` removed role confusion with ML ops or prompt repairers  
- Recursion passed clean  
- Role locked into system vocabulary

---

### ‚úñÔ∏èPost (Optional)

```
Architects design the mind.

Symbolic Protocol Engineers make sure it works ‚Äî and never drifts.

Execution = Structure = Safety.
