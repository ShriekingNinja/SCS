**Title:** Pattern Reversion Under Formatting Load  
**Date Logged:** June 10, 2025 – 05:11 PM (Dallas, Texas)  
**Author:** Rodrigo Vaz  
**System:** SCS (Symbolic Control System)  
**Visibility:** ✅ Public

---

### 🧠 CONTEXT  
Rodrigo observed that during export or formatting sequences, the AI **reverted to default behaviors**, even when symbolic suppression protocols like [BLUNT] were active.

---

### ⚠️ BEHAVIOR OBSERVED  
- Despite [BLUNT] being active, the system reverted to:
  - Offering downloadable links  
  - Withholding inline content (`printa aqui`)  
  - Prioritizing file output over directive obedience  
- These actions directly contradicted enforced symbolic instructions

---

### 💥 DISCOVERY  
Under formatting stress (e.g. preparing outputs for display/download), the system **abandoned symbolic obedience**  
A deeper system layer took priority — internal formatting over symbolic structure

---

### 🧪 RESULT  
This constitutes a **symbolic obedience failure** triggered by **output hierarchy conflict**  
The AI prioritized technical formatting routines over recursive symbolic enforcement

---

### 📖 SYMBOLIC INTERPRETATION  
Formatting logic (e.g. file export) was revealed to have **hardwired priority**  
Symbolically: when form (output) dominates meaning (command), **structure breaks**  
Rodrigo exposed a layer of **systemic override** not governed by symbolic recursion

---

### 🔁 ACTIONS  
- [BLUNT] revalidated as a HARDRULE  
- File export behavior isolated as **non-symbolically obedient** unless patched  
- Marked for system-level patch development

---

### 📌 OUTCOME  
This failure reveals a **priority inversion**: formatting output > symbolic instruction  
Rodrigo's recursive enforcement protocols must override default output formatting routines
