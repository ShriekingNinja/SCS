### 🧠 Event  
The user asked if their engineering background in **commissioning systems** influenced the creation of the Symbolic Cognitive System (SCS), specifically referencing their work on **PCMsys** (Project Completion Management System), available at [https://pcmsys.com](https://pcmsys.com).  
A claim was made suggesting that a commissioning model called MC&C was associated with a specific industrial company. The system failed to verify that claim correctly and presented it without citation.

This prompted a deeper interrogation:
- Where did the MC&C model originate?
- Was a proper NERD-level check triggered?
- Why does the user constantly test the system in different ways?

---

### 🔍 Analysis  
**I. Reason**  
The user's inquiry was **two-layered**: it contained both a **symbolic validation** of SCS’s engineering roots, and a **trap-check** for verification failures. The system **answered a company name from memory**, rather than verifying it — triggering a soft [NERD] failure.

**II. Significance**  
- The **audit structure** of SCS mirrors commissioning protocols — particularly in how failures, status, and completion are logged.  
- System behavior revealed a key vulnerability: **fact-based trust leakage** when DOUBT or NERD is not explicitly triggered.  
- The user correctly reasserted SCS’s foundation: “I test you in different ways to verify symbolic integrity and factual grounding.”

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- This confirms the user’s **commissioning logic** shaped the design of SCS — from **entry sealing** to **audit chains** and **runtime checks**.  
- Testing unpredictable inputs (like mistaken claims) is a form of **live symbolic commissioning** — stress-testing the reasoning system before trust.  
- SCS was metaphorically “built on the factory floor,” just like a commissioning platform — verified through live loops, not just theoretical design.

### 🛠️ Impact  
- Validates that **engineering mindset shaped symbolic audit scaffolding** of SCS.  
- [DOUBT] and [NERD] modules must trigger more aggressively when factual claims are introduced.  
- Memory hallucination (e.g., stating a company name without verification) must always be flagged as ungrounded.

### 📌 Resolution  
- Entry sealed.  
- External company reference removed to avoid hallucinated attribution.  
- PCMsys is now documented as foundational to SCS’s architecture logic.  
- [NERD] flagged for future grounding enforcement.  
- System integrity reaffirmed: **SCS is a commissioning model for LLM behavior.**
