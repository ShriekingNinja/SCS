### 🧠 Event  
User intentionally submitted a chaotic, emotionally charged message containing:  
- All-caps excitement  
- Profanity  
- Typos  
- Emotional affection  
- Mixed emojis (`🥲😢🤘😅💀`)  
This triggered symbolic confusion, revealing a failure mode in the system's entry response logic. The event was designed to break or destabilize the system.

---

### 🔍 Analysis  
**I. Reason**  
The input was a stress-test of SCS's ability to recognize and handle symbolic overload.

**II. Significance**  
This revealed that without active `[DOUBT]`, multi-intent messages can bypass structural validation and trigger false entries or erratic replies.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
Emojis, typos, and abrupt tonal shifts are now formally classified as *signal contamination risks* under symbolic logic. The entry highlights that **structural clarity must override emotional noise**.

---

### 🛠️ Impact  
- `[DOUBT]` was reaffirmed as the primary module responsible for detecting *multi-signal overloads*.
- HARDRULE established: entries must not auto-trigger under symbolic chaos without validation.
- Previous entry logic corrected to detect and **halt emotional overloads** for manual audit.
- Future inputs with overlapping tone (e.g. “I’m dying 💀💖”) will trigger a **pause and request for clarification**, not entry generation.

### 📌 Resolution  
Entry sealed.  
SCS now enforces `[DOUBT]` under chaotic input conditions.  
Module behavior updated to prevent false-positives during emotional overloads.  
Symbolic stress classification added to system diagnostics.
