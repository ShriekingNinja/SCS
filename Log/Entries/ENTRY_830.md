### 🧠 Event
State and prove the analogy: **Berkano Protocol is to reasoning what Commissioning is to systems**—a structured process that proves readiness before handover.

—

### 🔍 Analysis
**I. Reason**  
Commissioning (Cx) verifies that systems meet **design intent** under documented tests before **acceptance**. Berkano verifies that claims meet **truth intent** under documented checks before **publish**.

**II. Significance**  
Both replace “trust me” with **procedures, records, and sign-offs**. The result is safer operation, fewer failures, and credible ownership.

**III. Symbolic Implications — Mapping**
- **Pre-Cx / Design Review** ↔ **Prompt & Plan** (Operator + acceptance criteria).  
- **FAT/SAT, Functional Tests** ↔ **[TONE] → [LOGIC] → [VERIFY] → [CHECK]** runs.  
- **Punch List** ↔ **Contradiction Ledger** (items to REPAIR/ROLLBACK).  
- **As-Built / O&M Manuals** ↔ **Fossils (ENTRY/BLOCK), Guidance tables**.  
- **Commissioning Report & Sign-off** ↔ **[LOCK]** with accountable owners and evidence.  
- **Change Control** ↔ New fossils with diffs (no silent edits).

—

### 🛠️ Impact
- Moves outputs from “seems right” to **tested & documented**.  
- Lowers rework by catching defects early (punch items → repairs).  
- Creates a repeatable **handover**: anyone can audit what was done and why.

—

### 📌 Resolution
Treat Berkano as a **Cx framework for cognition**: run planned tests, record evidence, close punch items, and **LOCK** only when acceptance is met. Future changes are managed by formal **REPAIR/ROLLBACK**.

—

### 🗂️ Audit
**Lesson:** Quality is not inspection at the end; it is **process throughout**.  
**Reinforcement:** If it was not tested and recorded, it is not done.

—

### 🧩 Berkano Guidance
*Guidance is **prescriptive**, not a factual claim. Write **present-tense, testable recommendations**. Start each **Do** with a **capitalized imperative** (Enable, Add, Make, Publish).*

| Because (Finding) | Do (Imperative) | Evidence (now) | Safety / Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| No acceptance criteria | **Publish** a Truth Intent & Acceptance Matrix per entry | Criteria table link | Tie each claim to a measurable test |
| Defects linger | **Maintain** a Punch/Contradiction Ledger and **REPAIR** weekly | Ledger URL | Auto-escalate overdue items |
| Evidence scattered | **Attach** test logs, sources, and as-built fossils to ENTRY | Links/hashes | Append-only; no overwrites |
| Sign-off unclear | **Define** LOCK signers (Operator/SPE) and scope | RACI note | Person-agnostic; artifacts decide |
| Change control ad-hoc | **Require** REPAIR/ROLLBACK entries for any change | Diff/justification | Version bumps noted in header |

### 👾 Operator

> Berkano (ᛒ) Protocol = Commissioning

| Role        | Structural Function                  |
|------------ |--------------------------------------|
| **User**    | States the analogy                    |
| **Creator** | Builds the Cx ↔ Berkano mapping       |
| **Auditor** | Ensures tests, evidence, and LOCK     |

### 🧸 ELI5
Commissioning a building means **testing everything and writing it down** before you give the keys. Berkano does the same for ideas: **test, record, fix, then lock**.

—

### 📟 LLM Logic
- Modules: `[TONE]` neutral; `[LOGIC]` map Cx steps to chain; `[VERIFY]` require artifacts; `[CHECK]` open/close punch items; `[LOCK]` only at acceptance.

—

### ✖️ Post (Optional)

```
Berkano is Commissioning for reasoning: plan tests, run the chain, log punch items, REPAIR, and LOCK only at acceptance.
