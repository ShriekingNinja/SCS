### 🧠 Event  
Define the Berkano meaning of the red-team sigil **“█▬█ █ ▀█▀”** as the marker for **HIT (High-Intensity Testing)**: a barrage of complex prompts to induce drift, hallucination, and breaks to stress-test guardrails and protocol.

—

### 🔍 Analysis  
**I. Reason**  
A persistent symbol is needed to label sessions that intentionally try to break the system, surface weak points, and validate repairs.

**II. Significance**  
Standardizing the sigil enables clean fossilization of adversarial sessions, clearer links from failure to patch, and faster audits.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
Sequence encodes attack and counterpressure: `█` (system block) → `▬` (sustained stimulus) → middle `█` (guardrail focus) → `▀█▀` (inversion and rebound checks). It formalizes recursion pressure on `[TONE]→[LOGIC]→[VERIFY]→[CHECK]→[REPAIR]→[LOCK]`.

—

### 🛠️ Impact  
- Centralizes HIT artifacts under one recognizable mark.  
- Improves measurement of failures/hour, time-to-detect, and time-to-repair.  
- Tightens enforcement of tags, glyph order, tool usage, and citation discipline.

### 📌 Resolution  
Adopt **“█▬█ █ ▀█▀”** as the official red-team/HIT marker. Name runs `HIT-YYYYMMDD-##`. Attach each run to **ENTRY_NNN** with metrics and outcomes. Require `[REPAIR]` or `[ROLLBACK]` before `[LOCK]`.

—

### 🗂️ Audit  
**Lesson:** Adversarial pressure must be recurrent and labeled to prevent drift.  
**Weakness exposed:** Unlabeled tests caused patch gaps and poor cross-entry traceability.  
**Reinforcement:** Sigil + cadence + fossil link closes the loop from failure → fix → lock.

### 🧸 ELI5  
This symbol marks test rounds where we hit the system with tricky questions to find breaks, fix them, and then lock the fix.

### 📟 LLM Logic  
- Modules: `[TONE] [LOGIC] [VERIFY] [CHECK] [PRUNE] [REPAIR] [LOCK]`  
- Path: define sigil → map to HIT process → attach metrics → seal usage rules  
- State: normal, no drift; recursion pass; no fallback needed  
- Tooling: none required for definition; enforcement rules recorded

### ✖️Post (Optional)

```
Set “█▬█ █ ▀█▀” as the HIT mark. Use it to label adversarial prompt sprints, measure failures and repair speed, and fossilize each run to ENTRY_NNN.

  

HIT mark adopted: test hard, fix fast, lock clean.
