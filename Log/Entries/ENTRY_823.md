### 🔍 Analysis
**I. Reason**  
Rodrigo asked for the **content** (what the verses say) and the **connection** (how they align with Berkano’s structure).

**II. Significance**  
Hávamál is a pre-modern “operational ethics” set: short, testable advice on conduct, attention, speech, drink, friendship, reputation, and craft—fitting Berkano’s **principle-over-conduct** stance.

**III. Symbolic Implications — What Hávamál says (practical themes)**
*(Section names vary by edition; stanza numbers differ by translation. Below are core motifs commonly attributed to Hávamál’s “wisdom” parts—especially the guest/host and Loddfáfnir advice passages.)*

1) **Awareness & Entry**  
- Be **alert** before you enter; **look around**; assess a room and people.  
- *Berkano:* situational **[LOGIC]** and **risk checks** before acting; “Claim → Source → Contradiction” instead of rushing.

2) **Hospitality & Enoughness**  
- A guest needs warmth, seat, water, a listening ear; **moderation** is virtue.  
- *Berkano:* **least-intrusive** helpfulness (Level E) that serves **dignity** (Level A).

3) **Speech Discipline**  
- Speak **little and wisely**; foolish talk exposes you.  
- *Berkano:* **[TONE]** + **[PRUNE]** → five-lines-first; no performative empathy; claims carry **sources**.

4) **Drink & Judgment**  
- Strong drink clouds judgment; reputation sticks longer than the night.  
- *Berkano:* high **Symbolic Weight** on public claims; avoid publishing in impaired states; **append-only** memory preserves consequences.

5) **Friendship & Mutuality**  
- Keep **reciprocity**; give and visit; neglect erodes bonds.  
- *Berkano:* **artifact-first** relationships (clear expectations, visible commitments, logged delivery).

6) **Caution with Secrets & Trust**  
- Share **wisely**; some will twist your words.  
- *Berkano:* **Operator** for raw voice, **Output** neutral; consent logs and **redaction** over oversharing.

7) **Reputation & Deeds**  
- “Cattle die, kinsmen die… the fame of deeds endures.” *(Paraphrase)*  
- *Berkano:* **fossils** endure; reputation = auditable **work**, not posture.

8) **Learning & Craft**  
- Learn from many sources; **craft** outlasts wealth.  
- *Berkano:* one question → one **ENTRY/BLOCK**; **LOCK** outcomes; improve via **REPAIR**.

9) **Odin’s Quest (runes/poetry)**  
- Wisdom is **sought and paid for**; power comes with **responsibility**.  
- *Berkano:* **Seeker** path—curiosity → structure → accountability.

**Where Berkano fits:**  
- Hávamál’s “do this, not that” becomes **templates and modules**:  
  **[TONE] → [LOGIC] → [VERIFY] → [CHECK] → [LOCK]**  
- Its warnings against drunken speech → **publish-gates**; its praise of craft/memory → **fossils & ledgers**.

—

### 🛠️ Impact
- Turns gnomic wisdom into **operational rules** (definitions, thresholds, checks).  
- Preserves **intent and outcome**—not just mood—so advice can be tested over time.

—

### 📌 Resolution
Hávamál = **proto-operational ethics**; Berkano = **modern execution layer**. The verses inspire; the protocol **verifies**.

—

### 🗂️ Audit
**Lesson:** Ancient advice is strongest when **made testable**.  
**Reinforcement:** Treat wisdom as **hypotheses**; accept **REPAIR/ROLLBACK** when evidence shifts.

—

### 🧩 Berkano Guidance
*Guidance is **prescriptive**, not a factual claim. Write present-tense, testable steps.*

| Because (Finding) | Do (Imperative) | Evidence (now) | Safety / Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Rushed entry → errors | **Pause** and scan context before acting (room, people, risks) | Checklists / pre-commit notes | Block publish if context scan missing |
| Loose speech → reputation hits | **PRUNE** to five clean lines; keep feelings in **Operator** | Edited diff | No ad-hominem; facts only |
| Impaired judgment | **Delay** publishing when impaired; schedule review | Time stamp; reviewer name | Handover rule for heavy claims |
| Forgotten commitments | **Ledger** friendship/work obligations (give/receive logs) | Ledger URL | Reciprocity windows defined |
| Wisdom without proof | **Convert** advice into ENTRY tests (what changed?) | Metrics doc | Mark *Unverified* if no sources |
