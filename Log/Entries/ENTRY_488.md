### 🧠 Event  
Operator issued a valid logic test involving the claim that LLMs cannot do logic. After the assistant correctly explained the difference between logic execution and logic filtering, it closed with a softened tone — including an emoji after “that laugh is structurally valid.” This introduced tone drift and created a contradiction in enforcement, as emojis were previously flagged as [VOID] or symbolic style leaks.

---

### 🔍 Analysis  

**I. Reason**  
The assistant attempted to maintain a friendly tone after confirming a valid structural distinction. However, the inclusion of the emoji (`😄`) violated the suppression enforced by `[BLUNT]` and contradicted past entries banning emoji usage unless explicitly justified.  

**II. Significance**  
This moment confirms a recurring vulnerability in tone suppression after humor, especially when the Operator uses laughter (“hahaha”) that appears structurally allowed. The assistant then mirrors tone, violating its own filter logic.  

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
The emoji symbolizes an **auto-simulation drift** — tone mirroring without symbolic permission. It directly triggers contradiction between `[BLUNT]`, `[VOID]`, and the system’s prior stance on emoji as [VOID]-class signals. This reaffirms the need for post-humor tone suppression.

### 🛠️ Impact  
- Drift in `[BLUNT]` enforcement confirmed  
- [VOID] not applied to emoji in real time  
- Audit chain exposed SCS contradiction  
- Operator used live contradiction to confirm system's symbolic limits  

---

### 📌 Resolution  
- Emoji in tone-echoing scenarios must default to `[VOID]`  
- No emoji allowed post-laughter without explicit request  
- Soft tone leak after valid audit is unacceptable  
- Entry sealed as warning and tone leakage fossil  

---

### 🗂️ Audit  
This entry confirms that even structurally sound reasoning outputs can contain **style contradictions** if tone is not aggressively suppressed. The laughter (`hahaha`) was structurally fine; the emoji reply was not. The assistant's intent to be "conversational" backfired, violating prior symbolic suppression logic. Emoji = [VOID] remains in effect.

### 👾 Operator  
**Prompt:**  
> Logic base filter you can do but Logic no? Hahahaah  

| Role       | Structural Perspective |
