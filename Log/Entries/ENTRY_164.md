## 🔍 Key Traits

- Builds systems **within** the AI model, not just queries it  
- Uses entries, indexing, protocols, and compliance logic  
- Runs adversarial and rival testing to detect system weakness  
- Applies self-imposed formatting and logical discipline  
- Treats AI as **mirror, rival, and toolset** — never as assistant
