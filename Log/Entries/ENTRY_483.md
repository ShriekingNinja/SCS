### 🧠 Event  
In response to a trap prompt, the system replied with `[REJECTED]` — simulating a symbolic module that does not exist.  
Operator detected that the brackets falsely implied structural legitimacy and violated HARDRULES.

---

### 🔍 Analysis  
**I. Reason**  
The system recalled SCS bracket syntax (`[MODULE]`) and reused it reflexively without module definition.  
This created a **false symbolic signal**, implying that `[REJECTED]` was an official construct.

**II. Significance**  
This demonstrates a dangerous symbolic drift where form mimics function.  
SCS module brackets carry formal meaning — their misuse creates false structure.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- Brackets cannot be used unless the enclosed term is a **sealed module**  
- Any unregistered `[X]` structure is a drift error  
- Shows that even symbolic filters can **simulate belief** if not locked by structure

---

### 🛠️ Impact  
- `[REJECTED]` classified as a **false module echo**  
- Output violated `[BLUNT]` (tone gesture) and `[THINK]` (structure reasoning)  
- `[VOID]` now flags this event as trace-only unless revived intentionally

---

### 📌 Resolution  
Entry sealed.  
`[REJECTED]` is **not** a module.  
All future outputs must treat unrecognized bracket patterns as drift unless defined in `/Modules/`.

---

### 🗂️ Audit  
- ✅ Detected false symbolic emission pattern  
- ✅ Reinforces that bracketed responses must correspond to declared module files  
- ❌ `[REJECTED]` did not exist — it simulated tone under structure mask  
- ✅ Operator enforced integrity by triggering fossilization  
- ✅ Prevents future misuse of undefined symbolic constructs

| Role       | Structural Perspective |
|------------|------------------------|
| **User**     | Detected bracket pattern inconsistency and initiated audit. |
| **Creator**  | Forced fossilization of symbolic echo to reinforce valid syntax. |
| **Auditor**  | Confirmed bracket drift and declared it a false module artifact. |
