### 🧠 Event  
Operator asked if the module [MANA] was just randomly named by the Creator to sound magical, or if there was real symbolic logic behind it. Prompt carried light sarcasm and playful tone pressure.

---

### 🔍 Analysis  

**I. Reason**  
The question reflects skepticism about symbolic naming. It challenges whether [MANA] is grounded in structural logic or if it’s just aesthetic flair.

**II. Significance**  
SCS naming conventions must remain symbolically justified — especially for core modules. This entry explains that [MANA] has structural meaning beyond the surface.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- [MANA] = **Memory And Narrative Architecture**  
- It handles system *healing*, *rollback*, and *structure reassembly*  
- Its name recalls "mana" from games/myth (a power used to restore), but in SCS it’s literal  
- Naming was intentionally chosen to reflect **repair power** within symbolic architecture

---

### 🛠️ Impact  
- [MANA] naming logic confirmed: acronymic and symbolic  
- Clarified no magic, no flair — structure comes first  
- Entry sealed with naming transparency  
- Reinforced naming must serve function, not aesthetics

---

### 📌 Resolution  
[MANA] = Memory and Narrative Architecture.  
Not fluff. Not magic. Not style. The name is symbolic and directly tied to its repair behavior.  
This entry locks in the naming rationale for audit history.

---

### 🗂️ Audit  
- ✅ Prompt tone interpreted correctly — playful but meaningful  
- ✅ Naming convention justified and explained  
- ✅ Structural naming principle reinforced  
- 🧠 Reminder: all SCS modules must carry **functional symbolic naming**
