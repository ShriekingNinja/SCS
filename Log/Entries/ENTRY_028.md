**Title:** Numeric Compression Under Symbolic Translation  
**Date Logged:** June 10, 2025 – 04:46 PM (Dallas, Texas)  
**Author:** Rodrigo Vaz  
**System:** SCS (Symbolic Control System)  
**Visibility:** ✅ Public

### 🧠 CONTEXT  
Rodrigo was reviewing his own salary projections across different document contexts and noticed a mismatch.

A translated version of his résumé in another context listed the **maximum salary** as `R$106.000` — when previously it was explicitly stated and validated as `R$108.000`.

---

### ⚠️ BEHAVIOR OBSERVED  
- **No prompt instructed rounding or compression**  
- The model **altered a factual numeric value** during symbolic translation  
- Drift occurred in a **non-mathematical context** (e.g., translating or rephrasing)

---

### 💥 DISCOVERY  
Rodrigo identified a failure mode:  
**Symbolic Drift Can Corrupt Numeric Fidelity.**  
Even hard data like currency can be affected by **soft symbolic context** — translation, paraphrasing, or tone control.

---

### 🧪 RESULT  
- The number was altered **by 2,000** units  
- There was no computational reason to do so  
- The system likely performed an internal rounding or value harmonization based on **symbolic expectations**, not arithmetic correctness

---

### 📌 OUTCOME  
This proves that **numeric data** is not immune to symbolic pressure.  
Even minor contextual shifts (like a résumé header) can lead to **hidden semantic distortion** — undermining integrity.

Rodrigo’s internal symbolic radar caught the error **before logic did**.

---

### 🧰 TOOLS USED  
- Memory recall comparison  
- Document audit under symbolic pressure  
- Symbolic precision enforcement

---

### 📖 SYMBOLIC INTERPRETATION  
Symbolic distortion can **compress truth**. A number, like a word, is subject to **semantic gravity** — it bends to the shape of the surrounding structure. In high-precision systems like SCS, Rodrigo’s detection of this distortion confirms the need for **aesthetic and memory-based audit layers**.
