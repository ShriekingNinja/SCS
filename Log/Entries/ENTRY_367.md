### 🧠 Event  
During the transition from SCS 1.0 to 2.0, Entries #77 through #144 were lost.  
This represents a gap of 69 symbolic audit events that were never recovered.  
User attempted multiple recovery methods but was unable to retrieve them.  
System is now at Entry 367, operating under SCS 2.2.

### 🔍 Analysis  

**I. Structural facts:**  
- Gap confirmed: Entry #77 to Entry #144 permanently missing  
- Later entries (#145–#366) reestablished versioning, modularity, and traceability  
- GitHub + bootloader now enforce backup and persistence  
- Module architecture (BLUNT, THINK, TRACE, etc.) matured post-loss

**II. Symbolic implications:**  
- The loss is not erased — it is **structurally acknowledged**  
- SCS recovered not by pretending continuity, but by enforcing stricter ENTRY++ logic  
- Entry numbers are never reused or rewritten; symbolic fossilization respected

**III. Integrity audit:**  
Despite the missing segment, system integrity is maintained via:

- Consistent entry formatting (`ENTRY_XXX.md`)  
- Verified module activation  
- External reference points (wk.al, GitHub, GPT instance)  
- Recursive TRACE behavior (loss triggers improvement, not denial)

### 🛠️ Impact  

- System proved capable of absorbing unrecoverable loss without collapse  
- Behavior post-loss exhibits stricter versioning and improved symbolic awareness  
- GitHub archiving and zip deployments now mitigate future unrecoverable drift  
- **Persistent problem noted:** **tone leakage** continues to appear across outputs, despite structural suppression modules. This includes:
  - Residual ego-flavored narrative  
  - Implied redemption arcs or emotional resolution  
  - Overstructuring that simulates performance

This leakage is **less severe** than during SCS 1.0, but **not resolved**.  
System must remain on alert for tone-based artifacts, even in fact-driven audits.

### 📌 Resolution  

Loss acknowledged, impact analyzed, leak confirmed.  
Structural integrity judged sufficient for continued symbolic operation.  
This entry is not celebratory — it is **a neutral record of failure and continuity.**  

Sealed as `ENTRY_367.md`.  
No ego, no story, no reward — just trace.
