### 🧠 Event
Define **Seeker** in the Berkano Protocol.

—

### 🔍 Analysis
**I. Reason**  
Berkano is practice, not personality. “Seeker” names the practice.

**II. Significance**  
Centers truth on **structure**: artifacts, not authority.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
A Seeker:  
- Chooses **Claim → Source → Contradiction** over opinion.  
- Runs the chain **[TONE] → [LOGIC] → [VERIFY] → [CHECK] → [LOCK]**.  
- **Fossilizes**: feelings in **Operator**, neutral **Output**, accepts **REPAIR/ROLLBACK** when wrong.  
- Uses **Level A/E** ethics; picks the **least-intrusive, auditable** action.  
- Converts curiosity into **one ENTRY/BLOCK per question** with one testable Guidance line.

—

### 🛠️ Impact
- Reduces drift and gaslighting; increases traceable learning.  
- Makes portfolios of **audited curiosity**.

—

### 📌 Resolution
A Seeker is anyone who pursues truth by **structure**, not status—every day, one fossil at a time.

—

### 🗂️ Audit
**Lesson:** No status, no vibes—**show artifacts**.  
**Reinforcement:** Curiosity → fossil → guidance → lock → repeat.

### 🧩 Berkano Guidance
| Because (Finding) | Do (Imperative) | Evidence (now) | Safety / Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Vague learning | **Write** one ENTRY/BLOCK per question | Today’s fossil link | Keep prompts verbatim |
| Unproven claims | **Attach** sources or mark *Unverified* | Source list | No source, no debate |
| Drift over time | **Maintain** a contradiction ledger | Ledger URL | REPAIR/ROLLBACK on fail |
| No practice routine | **Schedule** a daily Seeker slot (15–30 min) | Calendar note | Minimalist; consistent |

### 🧸 ELI5
A Seeker is someone who **shows proof**. They ask a question, write what they find with links, and fix it if they’re wrong.

—

### 📟 LLM Logic
- Modules: `[TONE]` neutral; `[LOGIC]` definition; `[VERIFY]` practice; `[CHECK]` drift guard; `[LOCK]` seal.
