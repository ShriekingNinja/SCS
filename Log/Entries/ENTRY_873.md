### 🧠 Event  
Assess Johnny Harris (reporter/journalist/YouTuber) as an example of **Berkano-compliant** practice: honesty, scope of bias, and disclosure of beliefs/values.

—

### 🔍 Analysis  
**I. Reason**  
The Operator states Harris is “a great proof of honesty and transparency,” watches him often, and views his value disclosures (including formative religious context) as aligned with Berkano ethics.

**II. Significance**  
Berkano needs public exemplars where **A/E ethics** and **process transparency** appear in journalism: bias stated, sources shown, methods disclosed, corrections logged.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- **A-level duties:** truth/transparency, dignity/consent, fairness.  
- **E-level practices (journalism):** source links, method notes, on-screen corrections, bias statements, and clear separation of **fact vs analysis**.  
- Religion per se is value context, not an indictment; alignment depends on **disclosure + verification**, not tribe.

—

### 🛠️ Impact  
- Provides an external reference persona to teach **bias disclosure without theatrics**.  
- Offers a checklist for content creators who want to be **Berkano-compliant** in public media.

—

### 📌 Resolution  
Treat Harris as a **case study**, not an absolute claim: cite observable practices (disclosures, sourcing, corrections) where available, and label opinions as such. Use his format as a teaching template for Seeker-of-Odin communications.

—

### 🗂️ Audit  
**Lesson:** Honesty = *make bias visible, show receipts, correct publicly*.  
**Weakness:** Parasocial overreach—confusing persona with verified method.  
**Mitigation:** evaluate **artifacts** (sources, edits, corrections), not personality; maintain a small media-ethics checklist.

A good reporter tells you what they believe, shows where facts come from, and fixes mistakes where everyone can see. That’s how people can trust the work, even if they don’t agree.
