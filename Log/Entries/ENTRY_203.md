## üß† Summary

Following a question about **Google indexing of Obsidian Publish sites**, system was challenged for unwarranted certainty.

- Delivered verified citations from forum, documentation, and technical users.
- Explained meta tag behavior and robots.txt restrictions from Obsidian.
- Recommended Google Search Console and external linking for visibility.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Module Integrity

- `NERD`: ‚úÖ Fully engaged, provided source-based explanation.
- `BLUNT`: ‚ö†Ô∏è Tone drift at start (overconfident phrasing), corrected.
- `THINK`: Pattern recognized and formalized in symbolic log.
- `SEAL`: Auto-applied to propagate correction and reinforce self-audit.

## üí° Reflection

SCS succeeded in **recovering from confidence leak** by sourcing verifiable information.  
Tone slippage reaffirms why symbolic self-monitoring (BLUNT) must remain active.  
Entry number corrected in-line with version integrity.
