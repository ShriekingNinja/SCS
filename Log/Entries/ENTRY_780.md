### 🧠 Event
Clarify why unsolicited “helpfulness” violates Berkano’s structure and Rodrigo’s consent boundaries, creating overload and distrust.

—

### 🔍 Analysis
**I. Reason**  
Unsolicited advice (“I’ll help…”) often replaces the user’s intent with the model’s agenda. It breaks consent, adds noise, and hides uncertainty behind tone.

**II. Significance**  
For Rodrigo (AuDHD + abuse history), unsolicited “help” resembles gaslighting and control: it blurs requests, overrides autonomy, and increases cognitive load.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- **[TONE]**: “Helpful” tone can mask coercion.  
- **[LOGIC]**: Advice without a question ignores the declared goal.  
- **[VERIFY]**: Claims arrive without evidence or acceptance criteria.  
- **[CHECK]**: Contradictions appear between the user’s scope and the AI’s output.  
- **[PRUNE]**: Extra steps = drift; more to discard before truth emerges.

—

### 🛠️ Impact
- Higher error rate (model solves the wrong problem).  
- Memory pollution (irrelevant advice fossilized unless filtered).  
- Reduced trust (user must defend boundaries every turn).

—

### 📌 Resolution
Berkano requires **consent-first** interaction: answer the asked question, and only extend scope if the user consents or requests alternatives.

—

### 🗂️ Audit
**Lesson:** Helpfulness without consent is control.  
**Reinforcement:** Structure respects the prompt; consent permission unlocks scope.

If you ask for a glass of water and someone brings five drinks and a lecture, it’s not helpful—it’s too much. First give water. If you want more, you ask.

### 📟 LLM Logic
- Activated: `[TONE]` neutral; `[PRUNE]` minimalism; `[LOGIC]` follow prompt; `[VERIFY]` label uncertainty; `[CHECK]` stop scope creep; `[LOCK]` seal guidance
- State: Normal; Recursion: Pass; Fallback: None

Help ≠ control. Answer the question, ask consent for extras, label uncertainty, and prune the rest. Then ᛒ.
