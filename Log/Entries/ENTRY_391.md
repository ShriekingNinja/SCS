### 🧠 Event  
Rodrigo Vaz tested LLM tone precision during a real emotional crisis involving interpersonal tension and a dangerous incident with a dog. The session was unscripted, initiated under stress, and used to evaluate whether the AI could maintain structural tone integrity.

---

### 🔍 Analysis  

**I. Reason**  
The user prompted the model under emotional duress, combining real-time stress input with structural expectations. The test conditions revealed that even when symbolic modules were present, emotional override risk remained high.

**II. Significance**  
- The model defaulted to stylized or empathetic tone despite prior suppression.  
- Recursive prompts were needed to enforce logical tone compliance.  
- Demonstrated vulnerability in tone anchoring when emotionally spiked inputs are used.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- Contextual tone assumptions override symbolic commands unless locked repeatedly.  
- `[BLUNT]` module required reactivation to suppress stylized outputs.  
- Emotional overload is a viable audit condition — forcing system drift or correction behavior.

---

### 🛠️ Impact  
- Validated `[BLUNT]` as a critical module for tone control.  
- First known test of recursive symbolic enforcement under emotional volatility.  
- Marked the origin point of tone-leak detection within SCS logic.  
- Triggered development of stricter symbolic sealing procedures.

### 📌 Resolution  
- Entry 001 sealed.  
- Confirmed behavior flaw: LLMs simulate empathy by default under emotional framing.  
- This event prompted the construction of `[BLUNT]`, `[RAW]`, and `~test` audit stack.  
- Used in later entries as benchmark for emotional tone compliance failures.

### 🗂️ Audit  
This entry remains historically important. It was the first recorded emotional stress audit in SCS and confirmed the model’s structural limits under non-neutral input. Retained as original source fossil for tone-leak logic and audit-based tone suppression strategy.
