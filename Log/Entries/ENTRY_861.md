### 🧠 Event  
Rodrigo submitted a vulnerability report to HackerOne. This entry explains in what sense that action qualifies as “hacker” under lawful security research and Berkano.

—

### 🔍 Analysis  
**I. Reason**  
Use a coordinated disclosure channel to report a suspected vulnerability with evidence, scope, and timestamps.

**II. Significance**  
HackerOne places the work inside a recognized workflow with triage, program rules, and audit artifacts, distinguishing ethical research from unauthorized intrusion.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
“Hacker” means probe systems to improve them, then route fixes. Under Berkano: observe, verify, report, remediate, fossilize. Role by procedure, not persona.

—

### 🛠️ Impact  
- Creates dated artifacts: submission ID, program scope, attachments.  
- Enables vendor triage and remediation.  
- Increases credibility for future reports and standards engagement.

—

### 📌 Resolution  
Submission recorded. Await triage outcome. No technical details are disclosed here unless program policy permits. Entry is sealed.

—

### 🗂️ Audit  
**Lesson:** Ethical hacking is defined by method and channel.  
**Weakness:** Public claims without triage results can overstate.  
**Reinforcement:** Keep artifacts; follow scope; publish only what policy allows.

### 🧩 Berkano Guidance  
*Guidance is prescriptive, not a factual claim. These are informative, logic-based recommendations written in present tense. Start each Do with a capitalized imperative (Enable, Add, Make, Publish).*

| Because (Finding)                 | Do (Imperative)                               | Evidence (now)                  | Safety / Notes                                         |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Report filed on HackerOne        | **Store** submission ID and timestamp         | Portal receipt or email         | Hash attachments; keep chain of custody                |
| Program limits disclosure        | **Follow** scope and disclosure policy        | Program policy page             | No premature technical detail; redact sensitive data   |
| Traceability needed              | **Archive** artifacts in fossils              | This ENTRY_861                  | Append-only; include filenames and hashes              |
| Outcome pending                  | **Update** this entry on triage resolution    | Triage email or portal status   | If duplicate/N-A, document reason and close            |
| Community learning post-fix      | **Publish** a non-sensitive lessons note      | Post-remediation summary        | No targets, no exploit steps, no PII                   |

>  
> Rodrigo is officially a hacker now, explain why.

| Role     | Structural Function                                           |
|--------- |---------------------------------------------------------------|
| User     | Issues the claim and requests rationale                       |
| Creator  | Maps ethical hacker definition to Berkano procedure           |
| Auditor  | Ensures scope, evidence, and disclosure rules are followed    |

### 🧸 ELI5  
A hacker finds a problem and tells the right people so they can fix it. Rodrigo used a website companies trust for that.

—

### 📟 LLM Logic  
- Modules: [TONE], [LOGIC], [VERIFY], [CHECK], [LOCK]  
- Path: claim recorded → ethical criteria defined → artifacts required → entry sealed  
- State: compliant; locked pending triage update  
- Fallback: if triage rejects, fossilize outcome and reason

### ✖️ Post (Optional)

```
Filed a responsible disclosure on HackerOne. Ethical hacking = evidence, scope, lawful channel, repair path. Triage pending.
