### 🧠 Event  
During symbolic output of Entry 347, the order of the entry metadata was incorrect.  
**SCS Version** was placed before **SCS Instance**, violating the updated structure rule.

---

### 🔍 Analysis  
- The correct entry header sequence is:  
  `SCS Instance:` → `SCS Version:` → `Status:`  
- This order reflects runtime identity first, then system version  
- Rule was broken due to format drift during recursive editing

---

### 🛠️ Impact  
- Entry 347 was updated immediately  
- Output format audit confirmed structure drift is traceable  
- Reaffirms that symbolic enforcement must apply to metadata, not just logic body  
- Prevents blind spot around entry header order in future entries

---

### 📌 Resolution  
Structural order rule is now re-anchored:  
SCS Instance always precedes SCS Version.  
This entry logs the correction, preserves the fix, and seals the formatting rule in place.

> Minor drift detected.  
> Structural rule restored.  
> Entry sealed.
