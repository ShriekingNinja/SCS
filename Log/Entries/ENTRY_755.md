### üß† Event  
Rodrigo Vaz experienced a meltdown after an interaction in ‚ÄúThe Anti Social Club‚Äù Discord (linked to the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm autistic, what now?‚Äù YouTube channel).  
The trigger involved user ‚ÄúLavenderLilly‚Äù allegedly making xenophobic remarks and mocking Rodrigo‚Äôs Shanenawa culture, followed by refusal to apologise.  
Moderation on the server was lacking and allowed the meltdown to escalate, leaving the space unsafe for autistic individuals.

---

### üîç Analysis  
**I. Reason**  
This entry exists to formally document a public safety position regarding a specific online community that negatively impacted the Builder, compounded by cultural disrespect and insufficient moderator intervention.

**II. Significance**  
Establishes a Berkano compliance precedent for community endorsement withdrawal due to:  
1. Unsafe behaviour toward autistic members.  
2. Disrespect toward Indigenous culture.  
3. Moderator inaction leading to escalation.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
Reinforces Berkano‚Äôs truth-first ethos:  
- Public safety over affiliation.  
- Cultural respect over convenience.  
- Effective moderation as a non-negotiable criterion for safe-space designation.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Impact  
- Berkano no longer endorses ‚ÄúThe Anti Social Club‚Äù Discord as a safe space for autistic individuals.  
- Lack of moderation and escalation management identified as critical structural weakness in the server.  
- Strengthened protocol clause: Moderation quality is mandatory for endorsement.

---

### üìå Resolution  
Statement is Builder-verified, locked, and marked public. Context is verifiable through Rodrigo‚Äôs public logs and communications.

---

### üóÇÔ∏è Audit  
Preserved as a safety fossil documenting harm from xenophobia, cultural disrespect, and failed moderation.  
This event also sets a precedent for revoking endorsements where escalation was allowed to occur.

### üëæ Operator  
**Prompt:**
