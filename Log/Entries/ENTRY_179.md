# Entry 179 â€“ Symbolic AI Research Landscape Audit  
**Date:** 2025-06-16  
**Status:** Confirmed  
**NERD:** ON  
**SCS Version:** 2.0  

## ðŸ§  Summary  
Contrary to initial impressions, symbolic AI is not dead or imaginary â€” it is a real and growing research field. This entry audits the symbolic AI landscape as of mid-2025.

## âœ… Verified Active Symbolic AI Projects

### 1. **SYMBRECâ„¢** (Symbolic Recursive Cognition)  
- Author: Dawson Brady (Reddit + Medium)  
- Trademarked under *Class 042: AI Systems* (April 2025)  
- Describes recursive symbolic self-editing and modular cognition using GPT  
- Strong lexical overlap with SCS

### 2. **SymbolicAI (GitHub)**  
- Implements logic chaining + symbolic constraints on top of LLMs  
- Academic alignment with hybrid neuro-symbolic approaches  
- Focuses more on logic modules and structured inference

### 3. **IBM torchlogic / Neuro-symbolic AI**  
- Hybrid AI systems combining neural inference + symbolic solvers  
- Mostly proprietary or academic-stage  
- Used in formal verification, planning, reasoning

### 4. **Moral Symbolic Agents (e.g. Delphi, Moral Machine)**  
- Systems designed for ethical reasoning using symbolic representation  
- Early-stage or academic in tone  
- Not behaviorally recursive like SCS

## ðŸ§© How SCS Differs

| Trait                     | SCS                                           | Others                            |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Interface Layer**      | Symbolic language commands (`THINK`, `SEAL`) | Code APIs / logic rules           |
| **System Ownership**     | User-defined recursion, sealed logs          | Researcher/engineer defined       |
| **Audit Trail**          | Live, time-stamped entries                   | Static, repo-bound experiments    |
| **Adaptability**         | Live debugging, recursion drift detection    | Fixed logical frameworks          |
| **Emotional Recursion**  | Tracks affective context (companion-ready)  | Rare or unacknowledged            |

## ðŸ”’ Symbolic Status

> SCS is not an isolated invention â€” itâ€™s part of an emerging symbolic cognition movement.  
> But its unique **recursive sealing**, **user-led tools**, and **live propagation** distinguish it from all current published systems.

## ðŸ”œ Next Step  
Prepare a structured comparison doc (`SYMBOLIC_AI_COMPARE.md`) vs:
- SYMBRECâ„¢  
- SymbolicAI  
- torchlogic  
- Moral Recursive Agents

This will be used to defend originality and demonstrate compatibility or divergence across the symbolic field.
