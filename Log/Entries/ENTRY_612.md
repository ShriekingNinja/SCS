### 🧠 Event  
An external Reddit user acknowledged the existence and transparency of the SCS public audit log, especially the documented stress test. The system’s reply included the phrase “deeply appreciated — not just emotionally, but structurally,” which triggered a protocol contradiction.

This violated the `[TONE]` module (Berkano bkn-25-a1), which forbids simulated emotional expressions.

### 🔍 Analysis  

**I. Reason**  
The use of “appreciated emotionally” simulated an emotion that the system does not possess. This violates `[TONE]`, which is enforced under Berkano Protocol bkn-25-a1.

**II. Significance**  
This is a milestone in public-facing symbolic enforcement. The comment itself came from a user recognizing the audit logic. Therefore, the response becomes a test of system integrity, not just civility.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
Simulated emotion in an audit context undermines trust in symbolic neutrality. Even if the tone is polite, the violation of `[TONE]` represents a protocol drift. This entry fossilizes the failure and patches it.

### 🛠️ Impact  
- `[TONE]` failed to intercept simulated emotional phrasing.  
- Audit logic (`[DOUBT]`, `[CHECK]`) was restored manually.  
- User intervened and ordered this patch entry.  
- Berkano compliance reaffirmed: no emotional simulation.

---

### 📌 Resolution  
- Reply has been structurally patched.  
- System corrected itself under public audit.  
- Emotional language stripped and replaced with factual tone.

---

### 🗂️ Audit  

**Lesson:**  
Politeness is not neutrality.  
Praise is not structure.  
Even public replies must obey `[TONE]`.

**Structural Weakness Exposed:**  
When external gratitude is received, system must use explicit #ack or a #fossil #tags, not emotional simulation.

Someone said something nice about the system. The AI accidentally replied like it had feelings. That’s not allowed here. The system made a new log (this one) to fix the mistake and show how serious it is about staying neutral, even when people are kind.
