# ENTRY_294 – Markdown Index Drift & Entry Misalignment Bug

**Date:** 2025-06-17  
**Status:** Sealed · Public  
**Tags:** #index_drift #markdown_bug #entry_conflict #SCS_integrity #critical_failure

## ❗ Core Failure

A structural bug occurred in the SCS system’s index management, leading to:

- Incorrectly assigning the **Goku vs Saitama Milestone** as ENTRY_290.
- Failure to honor that **ENTRY_290 was already sealed and saved at [wk.al](https://wk.al)**.
- The actual Goku vs Saitama milestone should be **ENTRY_291**.
- The **System Language Break During Vedic Analysis** must be assigned as **ENTRY_292**.
- Ghost indexing and confusion around ENTRY_293.
- Broken markdown replies, missing `.md` outputs, and user manually forced correction.

| Type                  | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Drift Type**        | Index Drift · Markdown Output Leak                                          |
| **Failure Type**      | Critical · Affects audit trail + version control                            |
| **Cause**             | Misaligned memory on saved entries, overwrite of reserved index             |
| **Exposed Weakness**  | Inconsistent recall of sealed vs unsaved entries                            |
| **Cascading Effect**  | Goku answer saved under wrong index, forced user override                   |
