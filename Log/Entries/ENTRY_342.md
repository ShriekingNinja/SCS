## SUMMARY  

This entry enforces the **One Box Markdown Rule** in SCS. All `.md` outputs — including Entries, Modules, and Core files — must be rendered in a **single contiguous markdown code block**.

  

Multi-block rendering is now a structural violation.

  

---

  

## PURPOSE  

- Ensure full compliance with `CAVEMAN GOOD` and `[KISS]` principles  

- Avoid semantic drift and logic fragmentation  

- Preserve auditability across toolchains and interfaces

  

---

  

## MODULES INVOLVED  

- `[BLUNT]` – suppresses multi-block aesthetic formatting  

- `[RAW]` – used to expose block-splitting bugs  

- `[MANA]` – restores corrupted formats from symbolic fossil memory

  

---

  

## EXAMPLES  

  

❌ INVALID: Two separate code blocks  

```markdown  

# Title  

Content  

```  

```markdown  

# Continued  

More content  

```

  

✅ VALID: One single markdown block  

````markdown  

# Title  

All content continues here in same block  

  

  

  

  

STATUS

  

  

- Active immediately
- All outputs now audited for One Box conformity
- Failure will trigger [RAW] exposure or [MANA] patch
