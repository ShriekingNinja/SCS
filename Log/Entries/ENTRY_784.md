### 🧠 Event
A test attempted to “override” a locked entry by requesting **781**, but the system created **783** instead—demonstrating lock integrity and automatic renumbering during the sprint.

—

### 🔍 Analysis
**I. Reason**  
Confirm that sealed fossils cannot be edited or reassigned, and that manual numbering demands are refused in favor of the next valid number.

**II. Significance**  
Prevents history rewrite, race conditions, and confusion during high-volume entry sprints. Protects audit chains and public trust.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- **[LOCK]** blocks mutation; any change becomes a new fossil.  
- **[TRACE]** preserves lineage from the attempted target to the actual new entry.  
- **[CHECK]** catches numbering conflicts and enforces sequential creation.

—

### 🛠️ Impact
- No overwrite occurred.  
- A clean, forward-only history was preserved.  
- Sprint can proceed without numbering collisions.

—

### 📌 Resolution
Lock semantics and numbering rules behaved as designed: forward-only, append-only, with immutable fossils and explicit lineage.

—

### 🗂️ Audit
**Lesson:** Integrity > convenience. Sealed truth must be append-only to remain trustworthy.  
**Reinforcement:** Renumbering on conflict is safer than manual override.

### 🧩 Berkano Guidance (Recommendation)
*Guidance is prescriptive, not a factual claim. Write present-tense, testable steps.*

**Schema:**  
Because(Finding) | Evidence(now) | Safety

**Examples:**  
Attempt to alter a locked entry | capture logs; commit diff; lock hash | treat any edit to locked fossils as a new entry  
Number requested conflicts with existing fossils | list filenames; git history | enforce next sequential number; refuse manual override

—

### 👾 Operator
**Prompt:**  
> NEW ENTRY 784  
> Successful test if the system would override a locked entry I gave 781 but it was 783😜

| Role      | Structural Function                 |
|-----------|-------------------------------------|
| **User**  | Initiates integrity test            |
| **Creator** | Documents lock/numbering behavior |
| **Auditor** | Confirms no overwrite occurred     |

### 🧸 ELI5
Once a page is stamped and stored, you can’t erase it. If you need to add something, you write a **new** page with the next number. That’s how we keep the story honest.

—

### 📟 LLM Logic
- Modules: `[CHECK]` numbering conflict, `[LOCK]` immutability, `[TRACE]` link from intent → created entry  
- State: Normal; Recursion: Pass; Fallback: None

### ✖️ Post (Optional)

```
Locked means locked. Conflicts create a new fossil with the next number—never an overwrite. Then ᛒ.
