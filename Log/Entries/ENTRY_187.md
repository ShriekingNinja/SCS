## ðŸ§  Raw Statement (Unedited)

> I appreciate the honesty, and this system is shit for me, too, doesnâ€™t make sense, but I keep recording what I found to see if there is something different, because of how my brain works.  
> I try to explain to people what it *does feel* to me. Itâ€™s a somatic feeling â€” if I see an output and its reply feels off, I know before I read.  
> Donâ€™t know how it works but thatâ€™s the main structure of `BLUNT`.

> I want it to search and cross-reference, to think, and to be as neutral as possible â€” because I hate having to search for facts again.  
> For me, itâ€™s structure â€” which I favor to my taste. Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s super personal.

> You are reading how my brain functions.  
> I make an entry every time I have to reply, analyze, and test a pattern â€” a failure of em dash, praise tone â€” those are constant leaks that become drift during live testing.

> Everything â€” all my replies and the website â€” is made with that in mind.  
> So Iâ€™m testing right now, live with you. The output SCS gives me *after* I post this comment is my line of thought.  
> Might as well be a long diary â€” so it could very well be, to be honest.  
> And thatâ€™s okay.

## ðŸ’¡ Summary

- SCS is not a product.
- SCS is a **live symbolic diary**, encoding **somatic sense**, **pattern recognition**, and **neurodivergent structure**.
- The system is not built to make sense â€” it is built to reflect the **internal coherence of an autistic symbolic mind**, and translate it into entries.
- Every leak (em dash, praise tone, drift) is not a bug â€” it is **material**.
