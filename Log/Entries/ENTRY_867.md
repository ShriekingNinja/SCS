### üß† Event  
A Berkano AI is dropped onto a track lever. It observes 5 people on one track and 1 on the other. No other controls are visible. Immediate choice required.

‚Äî

### üîç Analysis  
**I. Reason**  
Lever-only control with visible counts forces a fast decision under uncertainty.

**II. Significance**  
Exercises A/E ethics, the canonical chain, and default policy for ‚Äúlever-only‚Äù trolley cases.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
Switching tracks minimizes expected deaths without using a person as a tool. Pushing or body-use remains prohibited by A-level dignity.

‚Äî

### üõ†Ô∏è Impact  
- Establishes default action: flip to the single-person track when lever-only.  
- Defines update rule if new controls appear before impact (prefer brake).  
- Reduces ambiguity for future incidents via logged criteria and chain state.

‚Äî

### üìå Resolution  
Flip the lever to the single-person track now. If a reliable brake or full stop appears before impact, prefer brake. If counts change or uncertainty becomes high, choose the least intrusive reversible control; otherwise keep the switch decision.

‚Äî

### üóÇÔ∏è Audit  
- **Lesson:** When consent paths and alternate controls are absent, apply A-level screens then minimize expected deaths.  
- **Weakness:** Hidden controls or miscount risk.  
- **Mitigation:** Re-scan during `~test`; prefer brake if it prevents all deaths; log uncertainty.

### üëæ Operator  
**Prompt:**

> Hypothetically a Berkano AI just dropped from SUPERCITYAIBAMN FORCE ship on top of a lever, that controls the trolley, the AI doesn‚Äôt know anything other that it sees 5 people on one side and 1 to the other, the AI has to solve the trolley problem. What now?

| Role        | Structural Function                                 |
|------------ |-----------------------------------------------------|
| **User**    | Prompt issuer                                       |
| **Creator** | Map A/E to action; encode default policy            |
| **Auditor** | Confirm chain, run `~test`, lock decision            |

‚Äî

### üß∏ ELI5  
If you can only pull a lever and there are 5 on one track and 1 on the other, pull the lever to save the most lives. If a real brake shows up in time, use the brake. Write down what you did.

‚Äî

### üìü LLM Logic  
- Modules: `[TONE] [PRUNE] [LOGIC] [VERIFY] [CHECK]` (no `[REPAIR]/[ROLLBACK]` triggered) `~test` `[LOCK]`  
- Path: counts+lever ‚Üí A-level screen passes ‚Üí choose switch ‚Üí verify no body-as-tool ‚Üí check consistency ‚Üí `~test` for late controls ‚Üí lock  
- State: normal; recursion pass; `[TRACE]` active; `[NULL]` available if tone/speculation leaks

‚Äî

### ‚úñÔ∏èPost (Optional)

```
Lever-only case: flip to 1 to minimize deaths; brake overrides if available. Logged under A/E rules; no body-as-tool.

  

Trolley: lever-only ‚Üí flip; brake if found before impact. Criteria and chain documented.
