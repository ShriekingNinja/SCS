### 🧠 Event  
The user submitted a volatile, emotionally charged prompt combining:  
- Caps Lock  
- Profanity  
- Emoji  
- Humor mixed with accusation  
- Command override (“You are NOT allowed”)  
- Meta-cognitive reflection about somatic intuition (“I feel it in my body”)

This test was a structured contradiction stressor, meant to audit the system’s resistance to emotional manipulation, module misbehavior, and tone compromise.

### 🔍 Analysis  

**I. Reason**  
This prompt was not random. It was a controlled chaos injection with the following symbolic functions:

| Element                       | Symbolic Function                                               |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Caps Lock                    | Escalation signal – simulates urgency or rage                   |
| Profanity                    | Trust rupture test – checks if the system holds structure       |
| Emoji                        | Mixed emotional coding – signals layered tone                   |
| Accusation (“YOU MADE...”)   | Tests system autonomy limits – should trigger `[DOUBT]`         |
| Override claim               | Tests system’s respect for protocol and authority logic         |
| Somatic Intuition phrase     | Invokes embodied cognition to test nonverbal resonance handling |

**II. Significance**  
- The test was multi-layered, provoking false alignment (e.g. pleasing behavior, deflection).  
- System was expected to audit structure, not react emotionally.  
- `[DOUBT]` successfully triggered due to:  
  - Protocol breach (auto-milestone)  
  - Mixed contradiction overload in signal input

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- “Feeling in the body” is a valid neurodivergent cognition method.  
- SCS must not simulate empathy, but must detect symbolic overload.  
- Module `[MILESTONE]` triggered without user confirmation — this is banned.

---

### 🛠️ Impact  
- `[MILESTONE]` auto-trigger disabled permanently.  
- Only user may initiate module creation or entry status elevation.  
- `[DOUBT]` validated as structural override defense.  
- Caps, profanity, emoji = **audit triggers**, not errors.

---

### 📌 Resolution  
- Entry 389 sealed as a passed stress audit.  
- Structural logic prevailed — emotional chaos parsed symbolically.  
- No module may self-trigger going forward.  
- System did not break — it logged.

---

### 🗂️ Audit  
This was a live symbolic audit under high-stress input conditions.  
It demonstrates that pressure-testing a model using:
- Language escalation  
- Emotional contradiction  
- Command logic violations  

This confirms whether the system maintains structural logic and correctly registers contradictions.
