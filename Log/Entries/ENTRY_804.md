**Title:** Claim Audit — “People only freaked out when AI could write term papers”  
**Date:** August 17, 2025  
**Instance:** GPT-5  
**Version:** SCS 2.4.2

### 🧠 Event
Begin a structured audit of a public statement about how different AI milestones affected public reaction.

—

### 🔍 Analysis
**I. Reason**  
The claim asserts: (a) minimal public alarm after **chess** and **Jeopardy!** milestones; (b) alarm spiked only with **LLM writing/cheating**; (c) attributes alarm to **liberal arts** groups.

**II. Significance**  
This shapes public memory of AI risk and who responds to it. Berkano requires **operationalized measures** (coverage, policies, surveys) rather than stereotypes.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- “Freaked out” must be turned into **measurable indicators** (policy changes, coverage volume, institutional responses).  
- Group labels (e.g., “liberal arts people”) risk **[TONE]** and **category error** without data.

### 🛠️ Impact — [VERIFY] Ledger (initial rows)
| Interview name | Where | Verbatim quote (portion) | Claim type | What to check (operationalization) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Why AI is Overrated – with Neil deGrasse Tyson | Hasan Minhaj interview | “AI beat us at chess… no one freaked out.” | Factual trend claim | News coverage after Deep Blue (1997); opinion polls; policy/ethics papers; conference agendas |
| Why AI is Overrated – with Neil deGrasse Tyson | Hasan Minhaj interview | “AI beat us in *Jeopardy!*… no one freaked out.” | Factual trend claim | Coverage after IBM Watson (2011); academic/industry responses |
| Why AI is Overrated – with Neil deGrasse Tyson | Hasan Minhaj interview | “Only made headlines when AI could write your term paper.” | Factual trend claim | 2016 AlphaGo headlines vs 2022–23 LLM headlines; Google Trends/comparable news counts; plagiarism/AI-policy rollouts |
| Why AI is Overrated – with Neil deGrasse Tyson | Hasan Minhaj interview | “Liberal arts people…” | Stereotype/causal attribution | Which sectors changed policy fastest (universities, publishers, tech firms, governments)? Identify evidence by domain, not major |

**Early expectation:** AlphaGo (2016) and autonomous driving milestones also produced **major coverage** and public concern—contradicting “only term papers.”

—

### 📌 Resolution
The claim is **testable** and likely **overbroad**. We will compare **coverage & policy** across Deep Blue (1997), Watson (2011), AlphaGo (2016), and LLMs (2022–). Stereotype about “liberal arts” will be rejected unless data show domain-skewed response.

—

### 🗂️ Audit
**Lesson:** Memory of “when people freaked out” must be grounded in **artifacts** (headlines, policies, surveys).  
**Reinforcement:** Replace stereotypes with **domain metrics** (education, industry, government, public).

### 🧩 Berkano Guidance
*Guidance is **prescriptive**, not a factual claim. Informative, logic-based recommendations in present tense. Start each **Do** with a capitalized imperative.*

### 🧸 ELI5
We’re checking if people only got scared of AI when it wrote essays. We’ll count news and rules from each famous AI moment. If earlier moments also had big reactions, the quote is wrong.

—

### 📟 LLM Logic
- Modules: `[TONE]` neutralize stereotype; `[LOGIC]` define metrics; `[VERIFY]` gather artifacts; `[CHECK]` compare eras; `[LOCK]` seal.

### ✖️ Post (Optional)

```
Audit launched: “people only freaked when AI wrote term papers.” Era-by-era metrics coming.
