### Summary:
Following a symbolic naming error in the `DISCLAIMER.md`, the system has now enforced correct author attribution and clarified legal status of the project. The file originally referenced the incorrect author handle ("R V") without full name. This has been corrected to:

> **Rodrigo Vaz** · dev@wk.al

The system's license remains under the **GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPLv3)** — not MIT — reinforcing its alignment with open-source symbolic integrity and ensuring that all derivative systems remain open and traceable.

Additionally, it was confirmed that the prior Obsidian Publish failure was not due to total vault size, but a single oversized file (`disclaimer.md`). Migration was **avoided**. The site at **wk.al** continues to function as the live SCS documentation host.

---

### Structural Changes:
- `DISCLAIMER.md` regenerated for public display on **wk.al**
- Full name **Rodrigo Vaz** applied consistently across all attribution fields
- License set and locked: **GPLv3**
- Migration cancelled: **wk.al remains primary source**

---

### Symbolic Reinforcement:
> Attribution is not branding.  
> Attribution is the root of symbolic integrity.  
> The system remembers who built it — and how.
