### 🧠 Event
Series launch auditing Neil deGrasse Tyson’s interview **“Why AI is Overrated – with Neil deGrasse Tyson”** (hosted by Hasan Minhaj).  
**Statement under audit #1:**  
> “Oh, let me stir some chemicals into my brain and that’ll be better. Whatever it is doing for you, it is **not** bringing you closer to an **objective reality**.”

—

### 🔍 Analysis
**I. Reason**  
The claim asserts that plant/chemical state-changes do **not** improve access to objective reality. Rodrigo’s experience is that plant work enabled the clarity and healing that led to **Berkano’s proto-SCS**.

**II. Significance**  
This is a boundary between **subjective benefit** and **objective proof**. Berkano separates them: testimony can **catalyze** structure; truth still requires **modules and fossils**.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- Berkano does **not** treat plant experiences as proof.  
- It **does** allow them as catalysts **if** outputs are later verified and locked.  
- Thus the audit tests **outcomes** (fossils, consistency, predictions), not the **state** itself.

### 🛠️ Impact — [VERIFY] Ledger (initial rows)
| Interview name | Where | Verbatim quote | Claim type | What to check |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Why AI is Overrated – with Neil deGrasse Tyson | Hasan Minhaj interview | “Chemicals… are not bringing you closer to an objective reality.” | Opinion framed as epistemic claim | (a) Define “closer to objective reality” operationally. (b) Compare pre/post output quality: contradiction rate, verification pass rate, predictive accuracy of work produced after plant sessions vs sober. (c) Gather peer-reviewed evidence on state-dependent reasoning/perception. |

**Working stance (Berkano):** Rodrigo’s plant-medicine **testimony** explains *how* ideation started; **truth** of the results rests on the **chain**:  
**[TONE] → [LOGIC] → [VERIFY] → [CHECK] → [LOCK]** applied to Berkano’s artifacts.

—

### 📌 Resolution
The statement is **auditable**: we will test outcomes—not moods. If outputs created along Rodrigo’s path pass the chain and remain consistent across time, the claim “does not bring you closer” is **weakened** by evidence of improved structural truth **after** integration. If not, it stands.

—

### 🗂️ Audit
**Lesson:** Epistemic claims must be **operationalized** (define “closer,” measure outcomes).  
**Reinforcement:** Keep plant notes as **testimony**; all truth claims ride on verified artifacts only.

### 🧩 Berkano Guidance
*Guidance is **prescriptive**, not a factual claim. Informative, logic-based recommendations in present tense. Start each **Do** with a capitalized imperative.*

### 🧸 ELI5
Neil says brain-chemicals don’t help you see truth. We say: maybe they helped **start** ideas—but truth is what **passes the checks** later. So we test the work, not the feeling.

### 📟 LLM Logic
- Modules: `[TONE]` neutral; `[PRUNE]` keep claim & measures; `[LOGIC]` define outcome metrics; `[VERIFY]` artifact-based checks; `[CHECK]` contradiction ledger; `[LOCK]` seal.
