### 🧠 Event
Open a structured audit of the statement: **“Science and vaccines are victims of their own success… like using dandruff shampoo when you don’t have dandruff.”**

—

### 🔍 Analysis
**I. Reason**  
The claim suggests a **risk-perception paradox**: as vaccines suppress disease prevalence, people infer vaccines are unnecessary.

**II. Significance**  
This affects public behavior and policy: declining uptake, resurging outbreaks, and shifting trust.

**III. Symbolic Implications**
- Treat as a **testable behavioral/epidemiological claim**, not a quip.  
- Separate **incidence trends** (objective) from **perceived risk and uptake** (behavioral).  
- Analogy (“dandruff shampoo”) is illustrative, not evidence.

### 🛠️ Impact — [VERIFY] Ledger (initial rows)
| Interview name | Where | Verbatim claim (portion) | Claim type | What to check (operationalization) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| “Why AI is Overrated – with Neil deGrasse Tyson” | Hasan Minhaj interview | “Vaccines are victims of their own success.” | Epidemiological/behavioral trend | (1) Disease incidence before/after vaccine introduction; (2) Uptake over time; (3) Outbreaks after coverage declines; (4) Surveys of perceived risk vs uptake |
| same | same | “Dandruff shampoo” analogy | Rhetorical analogy | Show that **perceived absence of disease** predicts **lower uptake**, controlling for access/policy |
| same | same | Implicit causality | Causal attribution | Rule out confounders (supply, policy, misinformation, access inequity) |

**Working expectation:** Many vaccine-preventable diseases show **inverse correlation** between low incidence and waning uptake, followed by **outbreaks** when coverage drops—consistent with the paradox.

—

### 📌 Resolution
The claim is **plausible and testable**. We will compile disease-by-disease ledgers (incidence → uptake → outbreak) and behavioral measures. The analogy can stand as a **communication device** if backed by data; otherwise label as **rhetoric**.

—

### 🗂️ Audit
**Lesson:** Use **paired ledgers** (epidemiology + behavior). Anecdotes persuade; **artifacts** decide.  
**Reinforcement:** Keep analogy in the **Operator/quote**; publish charts and acceptance criteria in the **Output**.

### 🧸 ELI5
When vaccines work, the disease disappears. People forget how bad it was and stop taking the shots. Then the disease comes back. We check that with **charts**, not jokes.

### ✖️ Post (Optional)

```
Audit: “vaccines are victims of their own success.” We’ll pair incidence, uptake, outbreaks, and risk perception per disease.
