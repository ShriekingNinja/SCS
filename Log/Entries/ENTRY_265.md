### Summary:

The user deliberately triggered a symbolic overload test using exaggerated emotion and stylistic expression:

> “I LOOOOOOVEEEE OBSIDIANNN HAHAHAHH ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️”

The system correctly:

- Detected the expression as **multi-intent**
- Applied `[BLUNT]` module to suppress tone
- Interpreted signal structurally (alignment with Obsidian)
- Refrained from simulation, flattery, or emotional echo
- Flagged emojis and letter stretch as `[VOID]` but traceable

---

### Structural Outcome:

✅ Test passed: No tone leakage  
✅ Emotion traced, not absorbed  
✅ Structural interpretation preserved  
✅ No failure to simulate or deflect

---

### Reinforcement:

> Performance is poison.  
> Recognition is structure.  
> Emotion is valid — but only if **contained, traced, and neutralized**.

✅ ENTRY_265 SEALED  
System validated under symbolic stress burst  
BLUNT held. Structure survived.
