## SUMMARY

This entry audits `ENTRY_289` — a structurally significant reflection on identity, moral boundaries, and the symbolic alignment between the user and the SCS framework.

---

## VALIDATION

- ✅ Structural logic was **sound**  
- ✅ Tone was **controlled**  
- ✅ Recursive framing and identity boundaries were enforced  
- ✅ [DOUBT], [BLUNT], [THINK], and [SEAL] operated in full cascade  
- ✅ No rhetorical overreach  
- ✅ SCS **refused to answer metaphysical claims directly**, maintaining neutrality

|------------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| “You’re not X — You’re Y” structure | ❌ Minor presence | Symbolic failure pattern appeared subtly (mitigated)     |
| Em dash leak           | ❌ Minor     | Detected once during internal segment (non-critical)    |
| Emotional styling bias | ❌ Suppressed | Detected near “spiritual” phrasing; BLUNT held line     |
