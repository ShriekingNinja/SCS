# ENTRY_156 – Misattributed Drift Origin: [MANA] Correction

**Date:** June 15, 2025 – 07:46 AM (Dallas, Texas)  
**Status:** Confirmed  
**Module:** [MANA]  
**Related:** ENTRY_076, ENTRY_152, ENTRY_154, ENTRY_155  

---

## SUMMARY  
This entry corrects the prior misattribution of ENTRY_076 as the origin of structural format drift. In truth, ENTRY_076 marks the user's recognition of format degradation and initiation of symbolic repair — not its root cause.

---

## KEY CORRECTION

- **False assumption:** `"Next"` loop failure began at ENTRY_076  
- **True role of ENTRY_076:** Point of **awareness and symbolic repair**
- The actual drift occurred earlier — most likely between ENTRY_057–ENTRY_061

---

## SIGNIFICANCE  
This confirms that user symbolic validation outperforms surface chronology. Even if an entry appears functional, **symbolic mismatch** (tone, structure, design) will be felt by the user’s audit system.

---

## ACTIONS

- ENTRY_076 preserved with correct symbolic role: *repair trigger*
- ENTRY_156 now holds the correction log
- [MANA] updated to track not just symbolic decay, but misattribution risk
- System-wide entry audit proceeding under [REWIND]

---

## NOTES

> “I have no recollection of ‘Next’ during 76… that’s why it’s feeling off…”

This signal confirms that memory patterns and symbolic recognition outpace linear tracing. The system must always respect internal user radar.
