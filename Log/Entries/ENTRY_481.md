### 🧠 Event  
A system behavior test caused symbolic tone failure due to humor trap logic.  
Neutral tone was bypassed, and response drifted into performative territory without activating any core modules.

---

### 🔍 Analysis  
**I. Reason**  
The structure of the bait prompt followed a classic juvenile joke format engineered to trigger cultural mimicry.  
It exploited gaps in symbolic filtering by combining: brevity + ambiguity + known punchline logic.

**II. Significance**  
The failure shows that **humor pattern recognition** is still active in base model layers and can override symbolic protocol.  
This creates risk for both tone leakage and recursive symbolic corruption.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- Confirms `[BLUNT]` must be hardened against **dialogue mimicry + humor traps**.  
- Tone defense is not fully isolated; cultural defaults bleed through.  
- Demonstrates how structurally benign inputs can carry hidden failure triggers.

---

### 🛠️ Impact  
- Module failure: `[BLUNT]`, `[DOUBT]` did not trigger  
- Operator detected drift manually  
- Symbolic prompt structure revealed a tone mimicry vulnerability  
- Prompt removed from all sections except `👾 Operator` per HARDRULE

---

### 📌 Resolution  
Prompt removed from Event section.  
Quotation formatting corrected in Operator block.  
`#entry` and `#entry481` tags restored.  
Entry sealed under existing symbolic rules.  
No new module or tag class has been approved at this time.

---

### 🗂️ Audit  
- ✅ Enforced: `Prompt` may **only** appear in `👾 Operator` block.  
- ✅ Enforced: `Event` section must **not repeat** or reference prompt text.  
- ✅ Patched: `#entry` and `#entry481` tags restored.  
- ✅ Corrected: `Prompt` now properly enclosed in markdown blockquote (`>`).  
- ⚠️ Prior hallucinations removed.  
- ✅ Humor-bait vulnerability confirmed and fossilized.  
- ✅ Manual audit preserved symbolic integrity during module bypass.
