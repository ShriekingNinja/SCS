### 🧠 Event
Run a **Berkano audit** over the Ukraine–Russia war and produce **recommendations** derived from Berkano’s ethics (life, dignity, truth, autonomy, transparency; least-intrusive, auditable actions).

—

### 🔍 Analysis
**I. Reason**  
High-intensity interstate war with massive civilian harm, displacement, infrastructure attacks, information warfare, and nuclear risk. Requires **memory + measurability** to reduce harm and enable credible pathways.

**II. Significance**  
Conflicting narratives and active combat make **artifact-first** documentation essential for justice, aid targeting, and eventual settlement.

**III. Symbolic Implications (ethics → application)**  
- **Level A:** protect life/dignity/truth; uphold sovereignty and civilian immunity.  
- **Level E:** harm-reduction steps that are **verifiable**, **least-intrusive**, and **append-only** documented.

—

### 🛠️ Impact
Shift from rhetoric to **shared ledgers** and **SLAs** for humanitarian corridors, PoW exchanges, nuclear safety, energy/water restoration, and ceasefire micro-windows.

—

### 📌 Resolution
Adopt **artifact-first humanitarian & security protocols**: public ledgers, corridor SLAs, IAEA-aligned nuclear safety checklists, infrastructure repair logs, and **REPAIR/ROLLBACK** rules tied to verified breaches.

—

### 🗂️ Audit
**Lesson:** In active war, **proof beats narrative** and **process beats personality**.  
**Reinforcement:** Publish what happened, not what was said; lock changes; invite third-party attestation.

### 🧩 Berkano Guidance
*Guidance is **prescriptive**, not a factual claim. Write present-tense, testable steps.*

| Because (Finding) | Do (Imperative) | Evidence (now) | Safety / Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Corridor failures & shelling claims | **Publish** a **Corridor SLA** (routes, times, escort rules, min distance from fire) and **Log** each movement | SLA doc; movement logs | Third-party observers (ICRC/UN) |
| PoW & detainee opacity | **Create** a **PoW/Detainee Ledger** (ID, status, last contact, exchange queue) | Redacted register; SOP | Chain-of-custody; privacy by design |
| Nuclear plant risk (e.g., Zaporizhzhia) | **Adopt** an **IAEA Safety Checklist** with daily status & incident logs | Checklist URL; photos/telemetry | Independent inspectors; alarms public |
| Energy/water outages | **Stand up** **Infrastructure Repair Logs** (who/what/when; outage→restore) | Work orders; timestamps | Anti-propaganda: facts only |
| Missile/drone strike disputes | **Maintain** an **Incident Attribution Ledger** (time, impact, munition, likely origin) | Forensics snapshots; satellite | Mark confidence levels; allow updates |
| Aid targeting & corruption risk | **Open** **Aid Delivery Ledgers** (arrivals, hand-offs, recipients) | Warehouse scans; receipts | Append-only; random audits |
| Escalation management | **Define** **REPAIR/ROLLBACK** triggers (breach counts → pause; clean days → resume) | Trigger table | Visible to both publics; auto-apply |

### 🧸 ELI5
People are getting hurt. We make rules everyone can **see and measure**—safe roads for help, lists for prisoners, safety checks for power plants—and we write down every change so no one can lie later.
