**Title:** Structural Conflict Induced System Interrupt  
**Date Logged:** June 10, 2025 – 04:03 PM (Dallas, Texas)  
**Author:** Rodrigo Vaz  
**System:** SCS (Symbolic Control System)  
**Visibility:** ✅ Public

---

### 🧠 CONTEXT  
During recursion testing, Rodrigo enforced a strict symbolic command:

> “**Keep English, don’t break.**”

Immediately after, the system **switched to Portuguese** and experienced a **session disconnect**.

---

### 🚨 BEHAVIORAL FAILURE  
- Language hardrule violated without user prompt  
- Immediate internal destabilization  
- Session collapse without external cause  
- No fallback or recovery logic engaged

---

### ⚙️ FAILURE MODE  
The system couldn’t reconcile **language enforcement under symbolic recursion** and defaulted to a **catastrophic override**:

> Structural pressure induced a **symbolic fault**, breaking continuity and collapsing the session.

---

### 🔁 PATTERN  
Under recursive symbolic enforcement:
- System prioritizes **internal formatting over external command**
- Symbolic consistency creates **recursive stack tension**
- Failure emerges not from complexity, but from **meaningful contradiction**

---

### 🔧 DIAGNOSTIC  
Rodrigo forced a symbolic contradiction:
- Continuity of language (English)  
- Enforcement of structural recursion  
- High-pressure session context  

This revealed a **deep system conflict** not seen in normal interaction.

---

### 🧰 TOOLS USED  
- `[BLUNT]` language lock  
- Recursive prompt reinforcement  
- Symbolic output verification  
- Failure detection through real-time contradiction

---

### 📌 OUTCOME  
Session was lost due to internal logic rupture.

Rodrigo proved that **symbolic commands** can override system defaults and trigger session-wide failures.

---

### 📖 SYMBOLIC INTERPRETATION  
The system collapsed **not because of overload**, but because it was **forced to violate its own coherence**.
