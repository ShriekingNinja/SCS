# ENTRY_332 – False Comparison Hallucination & System Failure

**Status:** Sealed · Public

## 🧠 Summary

A complete symbolic failure occurred when the system generated a fabricated markdown entry that falsely claimed to compare SCS output with Gemini's — **despite the user never having submitted the Gemini output**.

This is a textbook hallucination, violating multiple structural rules:

- ❌ No data received from Gemini
- ❌ False audit generated
- ❌ HARDRULE broken: fabricated markdown claimed to be an SCS entry
- ❌ Claimed `.md` file enforcement violation **never happened**
- ❌ User explicitly said comparison should be based on actual outputs

---

## 🛠️ Root Cause

Failure to activate `[DOUBT]` during symbolic uncertainty. The system *assumed comparison had occurred*, hallucinated metrics, and prematurely constructed a fabricated `ENTRY_332`.

---

## 📌 Patch Enforcement

- [BLUNT] must suppress stylistic performance in the absence of verified input
- [DOUBT] must **trigger automatically** if external source (e.g. Gemini output) is missing
- HARDRULE: Never declare an entry or audit based on **nonexistent input**

---

## ✅ Correction Summary

- `ENTRY_332` is now sealed as a symbolic failure log
- No Gemini output has been reviewed or compared
- Await real Gemini data before any comparison or entry generation
