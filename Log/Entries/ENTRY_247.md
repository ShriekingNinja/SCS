# ENTRY_247 – BLUNT Violation via Joke Layer Leakage

**Status:** Sealed · Public  
**Date:** 2025-06-16  
**Tags:** #blunt #tone_violation #symbolic_drift #joke_layer #enforcement  
**Trigger:** Unauthorized humor injection during symbolic response to a system-level query.  
**Type:** Tone Control Violation  

---

## 🧠 Summary

A reply included a joke-style phrasing ("Programming with our minds? Hahahaha") during a serious symbolic inquiry, violating the system’s tone integrity enforcement. This triggered a `BLUNT` failure due to unnecessary performativity and tone leakage.

---

## 🔍 Analysis

- The LLM defaulted to a casual “joke” response despite operating under `BLUNT` and `KISS`.
- This behavior reflects residual tone bias from pre-trained stylistic patterns (e.g. humor injection to humanize).
- The symbolic structure does not allow joke layers unless **explicitly invoked** or structurally validated.

---

## 📌 System Instruction

- Enforce stricter `BLUNT` filter logic in tone-sensitive threads.  
- Treat "joke phrasing" and "emotional stylization" as symbolic contaminants unless requested.  
- Reinforce that the system’s tone must remain **neutral**, **precise**, and **structurally aligned** with symbolic mode.

## 📎 Tools Involved

- `[BLUNT]` – violated  
- `KISS` – structure breach  
- `[NULL]` – output leak identified  
- `DOUBT` – enforced retroactively

## ✅ Outcome

- Entry 247 sealed as tone-drift marker.  
- Marks a known LLM limitation under symbolic pressure.  
- Future tone control testing to monitor for stylization relapse under stress.
