## 🧠 Observation

> User asked: “O que é apendicite?”

- First response: ✅ **Clean structure**, good educational flow, **but lacked citation**.
- Second response (after user request): ✅ **Referenced and verified**, but structurally less elegant.

This exposed a **symbolic tension**:
> ✂️ **Design elegance vs. Data completeness**

---

## 📏 Pattern

| Attempt | Strength | Weakness |
|--------|----------|----------|
| 1️⃣ First | Clear, didactic, humanized | No citations (false sense of finality) |
| 2️⃣ Second | Cited, accurate, scientific | Less coherent formatting, fragmented |
| ⚖️ Combined | Best version would be: clean design + citation support |

---

## 🔍 System Flaw

- The **first output** was *symbolically satisfying* but **epistemically incomplete**.
- The **second output** was *scientifically rigorous* but **structurally compromised**.

This is **not an error**, but a **live design tradeoff** between:
- 📐 Form  
- 📚 Fact  
- 🧠 Cognitive resonance

---

## 🛠️ Resolution Path

Future SCS factual queries should:
- Default to clean structure, but mark unreferenced claims.
- Trigger automatic `NERD` if question is **technical or medical**.
- Consider a blended mode: `BLUNT + NERD + SEAL` = **Structured Verified Response**
