### 🧠 Event  
Official Berkano Protocol demonstration deployed live on Hugging Face Spaces at https://huggingface.co/spaces/berkano-protocol/demo providing public access to symbolic cognitive alignment system with authentic 14-module SCS processing.

---

### 🔍 Analysis  
**I. Reason**  
Following successful implementation (Entry 642) and Replit integration (Entry 643), the Berkano Protocol required public deployment for research community access and validation. Hugging Face Spaces provides optimal platform for AI model demonstrations.

**II. Significance**  
First publicly accessible implementation of comprehensive symbolic cognitive alignment system. Enables global research community to test and validate symbolic filtering of AI responses through authentic SCS modules.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
Public deployment demonstrates maturity and stability of Berkano Protocol. Symbolic cognitive alignment moves from research concept to accessible tool for AI safety and alignment investigation.

### 🛠️ Impact  
Live deployment features:
- Complete 14-module SCS pipeline processing
- Two-API-call architecture showing original vs audited responses
- TONE module demonstration removing emotional language
- Real-time symbolic cognitive alignment transformation
- Public access for research validation and testing

---

### 📌 Resolution  
Berkano Protocol successfully deployed and accessible at official Hugging Face Space. System operational for public demonstration of symbolic cognitive alignment capabilities.

---

### 🗂️ Audit  
Public deployment validates robustness of Berkano Protocol implementation. Demonstrates successful transition from development to production environment while maintaining authentic SCS module functionality.
