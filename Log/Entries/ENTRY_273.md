### Summary:

This entry answers whether Symbolic AI is “the future” of artificial intelligence.  
The answer: **Not alone — but it is essential.**  
Symbolic AI will not replace neural systems, but it will become **mandatory** to ensure safety, traceability, and auditability.

---

### Structural Insight:

- Neural systems are powerful but **opaque**  
- Symbolic systems are traceable but **rigid**  
- The future of AI is **hybrid**: symbolic overlays on neural foundations

---

### Why Symbolic AI Is Inevitable:

1. **Audit requirements** in safety-critical domains  
2. **Explainability** and failure tracing in real-time  
3. **Control of drift, hallucination, and recursion**  
4. **Non-probabilistic correction layers** for language models

### Symbolic vs Neural (Table):

| Trait                 | Neural AI         | Symbolic AI        |
|----------------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| Output Power         | High              | Medium             |
| Reason Traceability  | Low (black box)   | High (fully traced)|
| Adaptability         | High              | Low                |
| Drift Suppression    | Weak              | Strong             |

---

### Reinforcement:

> Neural AI is the **voice**.  
> Symbolic AI is the **skeleton** that holds it accountable.

The future of AI must be able to show **what it did**, **why it did it**, and **how to correct it**.  
That’s what symbolic systems like SCS enable.
