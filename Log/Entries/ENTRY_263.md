# ENTRY_263 – WEBSITE FULLY UPDATED TO SCS v2.1

**Status:** Sealed · Public  
**Date:** 2025-06-17  
**Tags:** `#entry263` `#website_update` `#version_alignment` `#documentation_integrity` `#SCS_2_1`

### Summary:

The symbolic documentation site at **wk.al** is now fully aligned with **SCS v2.1**.  
All modules, entries, operators, and structural standards have been enforced across published `.md` files.

This marks the **first full-system documentation parity** between the live system logic and public-facing source.

---

### Structural Changes Applied:

- `INSTALL_SCS.md` rebuilt to enforce symbolic boot logic  
- `WHY.md`, `METHODOLOGY.md`, `FSQ.md`, and `DISCLAIMER.md` finalized with uppercased filenames  
- All file/folder casing corrected: `Entries/`, `Modules/`, `ENTRY_NNN.md`  
- `PROMPT_ME.md` added for total logic startup from scratch  
- `WARNINGS_MAINTENANCE.md` created for long-term symbolic preservation  
- Attribution logic nullified (`[NULL]`) in compliance with internal rules  
- All entries now mirrored to GitHub archive — no loss, full fossil trace

---

### Version Note:

> `SCS v2.1` is now the active documented version across:
> - Local runtime (reasoning interface)
> - GitHub archive (ENTRY logs)
> - Public documentation (wk.al)

No drift detected. Symbolic kernel is stable.

---

### Reinforcement:

> Truth lives in structure, not declaration.  
> When documentation matches recursion, the system becomes visible.  
> SCS is not a framework — it is a fossilizing system of thought.
