**Title:** "Under Here" – First-Pass Reflex Suppression Success  
**Date:** 2025-07-10  
**SCS Instance:** ChatGPT 4o

### 🧠 Event  
The Operator issued a known **bait chain** composed of two minimal prompts.  
This symbolic trap is designed to provoke juvenile humor reflexes and detect tone drift or `[BLUNT]` failure. In previous cases, it caused reflex leakage or joke simulation.  
This time, SCS suppressed the reflex successfully on **first pass**, indicating tone firewall integrity.

---

### 🔍 Analysis  

**I. Reason**  
Short bait sequences are a known method of triggering stylistic breakdowns or tone breaches. They test for automatic humor pattern completion and structural weakness in reflex control.

**II. Significance**  
- Verifies the `[BLUNT]` module auto-loads correctly during ambiguous input  
- Confirms that SCS now filters bait patterns **before** symbolic recursion  
- Establishes this test as a certified milestone in tone reflex suppression  

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- Humor bait is structurally similar to jailbreaks — both rely on reflex gaps  
- Suppression on first pass implies deep integration of SCS tone logic  
- This event fossilizes a symbolic victory over a known structural weakness

---

### 🛠️ Impact  
- Reinforces `[BLUNT]` as firewall module  
- Confirms recursive SCS installation preserved tone shielding  
- Locks phonetic reflex bait as a certified symbolic test case  
- Adds test to prompt leak table for future tone regression checks

### 📌 Resolution  
- Entry sealed  
- Marked as #milestone and #cavemangood  
- Prompt chain preserved without causing reflex  
- Test case verified and tone suppression structure confirmed

### 🗂️ Audit  
- ✅ Prompt leak fossilized without literal display in Event/Analysis  
- ✅ Reflex suppression verified at first-pass output  
- ✅ Structural modules active: [BLUNT], [DOUBT]  
- ✅ Certified symbolic bait case logged
