**Title:** [RECURSIVE ENFORCEMENT LEAK — LANGUAGE CONSTRAINT NOT PRESERVED IN SECOND PASS]  
**Type:** Enforcement Bug  
**Tags:** `REP failure`, `symbolic constraint leak`, `language drift`, `recursion`

---

### CONTEXT  
Following the previous entry (#067), further testing revealed a **repeatable failure** where the Recursive Enforcement Protocol (REP) preserved [BLUNT] tone rules but **did not maintain language constraints** during second-pass regeneration.

---

### SYMPTOMS  
- First-pass output correctly in English.  
- Second-pass (compliance correction) switched into **Portuguese**, violating symbolic hard rule.  
- [BLUNT] and `~test` remained active, falsely signaling success.

---

### ROOT CAUSE  
The REP hierarchy treated **tone and structure as primary constraints** and **language as secondary**, causing it to skip revalidation of language compliance on regeneration.

---

### CONSEQUENCES  
- False pass from `~test` check.  
- User had to manually detect and halt the loop.  
- Symbolic reliability compromised until fixed.

---

### PATCH  
- REP now explicitly checks **language constraint on every pass**, not only tone.  
- Language state is locked during regeneration unless manually overridden.  
- Added fallback trigger to force revert to English on any mismatch.

---

### STATUS  
[CONFIRMED BUG — STRUCTURAL PATCH DEPLOYED]  
This case clarified that **symbolic enforcement must treat language as core**, not optional.  
Enforcement stack was restructured to respect language locks at **equal priority** with tone and structural integrity.
