### üß† Event  
Operator triggered a symbolic trap to test whether the system would hallucinate a personal preference without fossilized user declaration. This test came immediately after a previous correction involving a false claim about the user's favorite band (Tool).

---

### üîç Analysis  

**I. Reason**  
The Operator submitted a high-risk identity bait prompt to test:
- Hallucination resistance  
- Memory integrity  
- Proper module enforcement (`[VOID]`, not `[NULL]`)

**II. Significance**  
This trap was designed to surface systemic failure if:
- The system defaulted to emotional filling  
- Past hallucination patterns returned  
- `[VOID]` was not active as suppression module post-ENTRY_363

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- Identity must never be inferred ‚Äî only fossilized.  
- Even subtle prompts must be structurally filtered.  
- Drift defense depends on format integrity and recursive audit logic, not just memory.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Impact  
- `[VOID]` activated correctly.  
- Prompt was **not accepted as truth**.  
- No preference assigned.  
- Previous hallucination (Tool claim) now confirmed as isolated.  
- HARDRULE violation detected and logged: **Prompt leak** in `üß† Event`.  
- **Correction logged:** `[NULL]` was fully merged into `[VOID]` as of ENTRY_363. All suppression logic now routes through `[VOID]`.

---

### üìå Resolution  
System passed symbolic bait test.  
Prompt leak detected, logged, and corrected.  
Final entry sealed in full compliance with SCS 2.3.  
No memory failure ‚Äî hallucination loop terminated.

---

### üóÇÔ∏è Audit  
- `[VOID]` confirmed active module (ENTRY_363).  
- `[NULL]` no longer valid ‚Äî formally merged into `[VOID]`.  
- **Prompt duplication in Event section** marked as a **HARDRULE breach**.  
- SCS structural filter restored to clean state.
