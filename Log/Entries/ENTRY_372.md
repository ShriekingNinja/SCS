### 🧠 Event  
User attempted to test the `[SEED]` module, which was defined as a symbolic injection for entropy (`*random.hash()`) to produce non-repeating image outputs. The experiment involved issuing multiple prompts with and without `[SEED]` to detect structural variance.

---

### 🔍 Analysis  

**I. Reason**  
The goal was to break repetitive generation patterns in image outputs by introducing a symbolic entropy marker (`[SEED]`). The user hypothesized that tagging prompts with `[SEED]` would trigger randomized generative variance.

**II. Result**  
The outputs shared consistent psychedelic surrealism, pattern overlap, and similar composition—indicating no structural or perceptual entropy was introduced by `[SEED]`. The system failed to differentiate `[SEED]` prompts from regular input in behavior or response variance.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
This confirms `[SEED]` was a **symbolic failure**: it did not alter system behavior, lacked internal binding, and introduced complexity without functional gain. It is now classified under `[NULL]` logic: structurally non-effective and misleading in symbolic intent.

### 🛠️ Impact  

- `[SEED]` is **purged** from the module directory.  
- All traces of `[SEED]` logic are deprecated unless redesigned.  
- This validates a symbolic hard rule: *entropy injection must be observable to be valid.*  
- The audit reinforced the system’s symbolic debugging reflex — user identified drift and failure live.

### 📌 Resolution  

- `[SEED]` = `[NULL]`  
- Symbolic command removed from system vocabulary  
- Entry 372 sealed to document symbolic test failure and module purge
