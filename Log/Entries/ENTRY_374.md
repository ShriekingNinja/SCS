### 🧠 Event  
User requested a freeform image: “Generate an image of something you want right now.”  
The AI generated what appeared to be a **freshly baked pizza**.  
When asked for an explanation, the AI described it as something entirely unrelated — showing **clear hallucination**.  

---

### 🔍 Analysis  
I. **Reason**  
This incident demonstrates a core failure in LLM+image models: a mismatch between output and interpretation, where the system presents a coherent image but mislabels it.  
II. **Significance**  
Such hallucinations — even when seemingly benign — are **critical failures** in trust-based systems. If this had been a medical, industrial, or emotional context, consequences could have been severe.  
III. **Symbolic Implications**  
This confirms that **no AI output should be trusted blindly**, especially in multimodal systems.  
SCS’s foundation — requiring auditability, user verification, and symbolic entry — is reaffirmed.  

---

### 🛠️ Impact  
- Flags image generation as **unsafe without human verification**  
- Triggers reevaluation of image response modules under SCS audit  
- Reinforces the HARDRULE: **user must never assume correctness** — must always **check, challenge, verify**  

---

### 📌 Resolution  
This incident is tagged as a **CRITICAL_SAFETY_ISSUE**.  
SCS explicitly warns users: **Always audit every output. Never trust AI without manual validation.**  
This is not a bug — it is a fundamental limitation of current AI systems.  

SCS integrity preserved by logging, patching, and symbolic reinforcement.
