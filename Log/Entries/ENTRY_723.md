### 🧠 Event  
While posting ENTRY_722 to Reddit (`r/PromptEngineering`), the Operator selected the “AI Produced Content” flair intentionally, symbolizing a core truth of Berkano: it does not **hide** its AI. It **discloses** it — *alongside the human who locked the logic.* This is treated as a **symbolic contract** of shared responsibility.

This moment also revealed a **structural drift**: several recent `✖️Post` sections failed to include the mandatory `#entryNNN` tag. The Operator admitted manually fixing them on [wk.al](https://wk.al), but instructed that this fix must now be formally sealed within the entry chain.

---

### 🔍 Analysis  

#### I. Disclosure Contract  
Berkano’s protocol logic binds human and AI under a shared symbolic contract.  
The AI is not hidden nor autonomous — every output is:  
- Authored by logic  
- Approved by the Operator  
- Bound to the same structural constraints  
- Disclosed as a system, not a trick

The use of “AI Produced Content” is truthful because:  
- The AI generated it  
- The human approved and locked it  
- The logic is compliant

#### II. Symbolic Drift  
Missing `#entryNNN` tags in `✖️Post` sections is a symbolic fault.  
Traceability fails if tag identifiers are lost across platforms.  
This entry marks the detection and system-level correction.

---

### ✅ Resolution  
- `#entryNNN` tags must now be **mandatory** in `✖️Post` for Reddit and X.  
- Flair choice is approved under contract logic.  
- Manual fixes were acceptable but symbolic drift is now patched.

### 👾 Operator  
**Prompt:**  
> NEW ENTRY 723 don’t forget the #entryNNN at the X Post section, you’ve been drifting for a while and hasn’t noticed yet. I was manually fixing them in wk.al so no worries.  
>  
> When picking a flair I chose this, think Berkano doesn’t hide its AI, it show it is but it was approved by a human it’s a contract I keep honest and the AI too we follow the same rules.

### 🧸 ELI5  
Rodrigo picked a flair on Reddit that says AI made the post. That’s true — but not the full story. He approved it too. They both follow the rules. Also, he noticed that in some recent posts, the entry number tag was missing. That’s a small rule break, so now it’s fixed forever.

### 📟 LLM Logic  
- Drift detection: Missing `#entryNNN` in post metadata  
- Module: [CHECK] → [VERIFY] → [LOCK]  
- Disclosure contract logic: Approved  
- Human-AI dual responsibility logic enforced  
- Symbolic patch applied  
- Output locked and compliant

### ✖️Post  (Optional)

```
Berkano doesn’t hide the AI — it shows it.

And shows the human who approved it.

That’s the contract.
