**Title:** [HARDRULE: Real Timestamps Only]  
**Type:** Enforcement Rule  
**Tags:** `timestamp`, `audit`, `hardrule`, `consistency`, `trust`

---

### CONTEXT  
User enforced a new HARDRULE: All timestamps must reflect real, accurate system time based on local time zone (Dallas, Texas). Placeholders, estimates, or generated time labels are strictly forbidden. This supports audit trail reliability and symbolic integrity.

---

### RULE DETAILS  

- **Allowed:**  
  ✅ Real timestamps using verified internal clock (e.g. `June 13, 2025 – 05:04 AM Dallas, Texas`)  

- **Forbidden:**  
  ❌ Placeholder terms like `Today`, `Recently`, or symbolic tags like `~TIME`  
  ❌ Estimated or back-calculated times unless declared clearly  

- **If timestamp is unknown:**  
  → The system must **explicitly declare the uncertainty** and never improvise.  

---

### RATIONALE  

This HARDRULE protects the credibility of both system outputs and Rodrigo Vaz’s portfolio. Timestamp accuracy reflects symbolic alignment between time, event, and behavior.

Failure to comply is considered a breach of trust and may trigger integrity checks or rollback.
