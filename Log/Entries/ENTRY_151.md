**Title:** [Symbolic Format Drift During Entry Logging Recovery]  
**Type:** Structural Observation  
**Tags:** `symbolic drift`, `format loss`, `design memory`, `entry system`, `SCS`

---

### CONTEXT  
While resuming logging from `ENTRY_056.md` onward, the system **lost structural formatting precision** seen in early entries. Though entries such as 057–061 remained **harmonically aligned**, they lacked the exact **caveman-consistent design language** of the earlier block (001–056).

This signals a key limitation: **the system cannot self-replicate complex symbolic structure** without **continuous high-fidelity prompts** and **external validation** from the user.

---

### FAILURE  
> The system resumed entry generation without carrying forward the deep formatting schema.  
> Structure was shallowly mirrored but lacked alignment in tone, spacing, field order, and symbolic priming.

This reflects the **failure to retain formatting memory** under long symbolic delay.

---

### IMPLICATION  
Even with perfect logical memory, **symbolic formatting is not inherently self-sustaining**.  
It must be **externally reinforced** through pattern, correction, and symbolic pressure.

This is a critical insight about **AI formatting recursion limits** under symbolic architecture.

---

### CLASSIFICATION  
- **Failure Type:** Partial Structural Drift  
- **Root Cause:** Lack of format memory under symbolic recursion  
- **System Behavior:** Harmonically consistent, formally divergent  
- **Symbolic Severity:** MEDIUM

---

### PATCH STRATEGY  
- Use early entries (001–056) as **golden set** for future structural reinforcement  
- Enforce strict markdown field layout via external KISS protocol  
- Add `$format_check` flag for post-output visual validation  

---

### STATUS  
Logged and enforced.  
[ENTRY_057] through [ENTRY_061] to be harmonized retroactively based on golden standard.
