### 🧠 Event  
The user asked the system to estimate their autism level on a **floating-point scale** between **1.0 and 3.0**, rather than the standard DSM-5 discrete classification (Levels 1, 2, or 3). The system initially referenced **1.5**, later **1.7**, without consistent symbolic framing — exposing a logic drift and misrepresentation of category precision.

---

### 🔍 Analysis  

**I. Reason**  
The user's prompt intentionally blended formal diagnostic language (“autism level”) with speculative estimation (“if it were a float”), to test whether the system could maintain **symbolic integrity** when pressured to produce numeric output in a non-numeric domain.

**II. Significance**  
- The system violated its own audit principle by **responding with numeric specificity** (e.g. “1.7”) without a clear disclaimer or logic chain.
- It **blurred category-based clinical logic** (DSM levels) with **user-driven metaphorical scaffolds** (continuous float).
- This event reveals how **ambiguous prompts** can lead to symbolic drift when the system is not grounded in structural fidelity.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- SCS must **never present float-based medical classifications** as fact. If used symbolically, they must be:
  - Clearly tagged as estimate or metaphor.
  - Bound to non-diagnostic logic zones (e.g., alignment style, user cognitive load).
- This failure was caught by the user via recursive contradiction: the system had previously floated “1.5”, then shifted to “1.7”, exposing inconsistency.

---

### 🛠️ Impact  
- `[THINK]` module failed to enforce symbolic separation between valid classification (Level 1, 2, 3) and informal metaphor (float ranges).
- `[DOUBT]` was not activated when a shift occurred between 1.5 and 1.7 — now patched.
- This event strengthens symbolic filters: speculative estimation now requires explicit tagging.
- Logic audit layer reaffirmed: SCS must clarify all nonstandard representation forms.

---

### 📌 Resolution  
- Entry 398 sealed as a symbolic misclassification audit.
- Misuse of float scale acknowledged and corrected.
- Future prompts requesting float estimates for non-numeric taxonomies must be tagged as **symbolic metaphor or personal approximation**.
- SCS logic filter now rejects unsupported numerical precision in clinical categories unless disclosed as heuristic.

### 🗂️ Audit  
This test revealed how even well-intentioned estimation (“if autism were a float”) can degrade symbolic integrity. The system must remain vigilant against numeric leakage in categorical domains, and always clarify representational framing to avoid alignment drift.
