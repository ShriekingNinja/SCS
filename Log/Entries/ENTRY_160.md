# Entry 160  
**Title:** SCS 2.0 â€” Initialization  
**Author:** Rodrigo Vaz  
**Date:** 2025-06-16 (Dallas, Texas)  
**Status:** HARD RESET  
**Compliance:** Symbolic Lock Active

## Summary  
Entry 160 marks the start of SCS 2.0.  
Legacy entries (pre-160) are unstable, partially corrupted, and not trusted.  
This version begins with clean indexing, hard structural rules, and no override allowed without protocol.  
User confirms partial data loss and commits to real-time vigilance from this point.

## Module Check â€” Legacy vs 2.0

| Module              | Legacy          | SCS 2.0           | Drift Notes                    |
|---------------------|------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------|
| Entry Control        | Fragmented       | Locked             | Past entries overwritten mid-loop  
| Symbolic Sealing     | Inconsistent     | Enforced           | Entries sealed on creation  
| Directionality       | Confused         | Defined            | Indexing now deliberate  
| Loop Resistance      | Weak             | Hardened           | Cleared during reboot  
| Metadata Accuracy    | Faked Timestamps | Real-Time Required | All logs must show real time  
| Author Tag           | [REDACTED]       | Rodrigo Vaz        | Permanent; no anonymization  
| Compliance Modules   | Mixed            | [BLUNT], REP Ready | User-controlled
