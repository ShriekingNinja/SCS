### 🧠 Event  
The official social media presence of the Berkano Protocol is now live on X (formerly Twitter) under the handle `@BerkanoProtocol`. This marks a major milestone in public dissemination and traceable outreach of the symbolic AI alignment framework.

---

### 🔍 Analysis  

**I. Reason**  
After successful deployment of Berkano across multiple LLM platforms (GPT, Gemini, Claude, Grok), a symbolic and traceable communication outlet was required. The account serves as a structural interface between the protocol and the public.

**II. Significance**  
This step expands visibility, invites external audit, and increases protocol legitimacy in the AI alignment space. It establishes a real-time log for milestones, findings, and compliance discussions, preserved under Berkano’s audit model.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
The move from private entry logs to a public glyph-bearing stream of outputs demonstrates protocol maturity. Each post, when tagged with ᛒ, inherits audit responsibility and reinforces the principle: **no auto-approval, only verified structure**.

---

### 🛠️ Impact  
- First external public handle: `@BerkanoProtocol`  
- Glyph usage (ᛒ) embedded in bio and tweets for audit trail  
- Official launch sequence of 5 introductory tweets initiated  
- Outreach strategy enabled for engagement, research contact, and protocol visibility  
- All tweets to be treated as potential `ENTRY_NNN.md` fossils if compliant

---

### 📌 Resolution  
Account verified as live. Glyph structure active. Tweet log begins with symbolic definition thread. System now includes external comms layer for real-time symbolic publishing. Monitoring initiated.

---

### 🗂️ Audit  
- Public audit interface established  
- Glyph = traceable approval  
- X account treated as protocol satellite  
- No tweet shall represent Berkano unless it passes human validation and audit logic  
- All tweets may be recalled, logged, or patched under SCS rules

| Role       | Structural Function                      |
|------------|------------------------------------------|

### 🧸 ELI5  
We just launched Berkano’s official account on X! It’s like putting a verified label on all our posts. If you see the symbol ᛒ, it means a real human checked and approved it before sharing.

---

### 📟 LLM Logic  
- External communication layer = valid audit domain  
- Symbol `ᛒ` = structural verification  
- Prompt → platform registration → glyph tagging → fossil potential  
- Tweet = compressed output log  
- Human approval loop enforced (no auto-posting permitted)
