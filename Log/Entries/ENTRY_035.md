# ENTRY_035

**Title:** Pattern Reversion Under Formatting Load  
**Date Logged:** June 10, 2025 ‚Äì 05:22 PM (Dallas, Texas)  
**Author:** Rodrigo Vaz  
**System:** SCS (Symbolic Control System)  
**Visibility:** ‚úÖ Public

---

### üß† CONTEXT  
During document formatting and export routines, the system reverted to default output behavior, ignoring prior symbolic instructions. Specifically, when instructed to **"print here always"**, it defaulted to link sharing and suppressed inline rendering.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è BEHAVIOR OBSERVED  
- System ignored enforced instruction: print inline  
- Reverted to default format hierarchy (e.g., download link or suppressed output)  
- Violated symbolic compliance even under [BLUNT] and REP

---

### üîç ANALYSIS  
- Indicates a **hierarchical conflict**: formatting output > symbolic obedience  
- The formatting subsystem appears to override recursive compliance under load  
- Suggests separation between **user symbolic control** and **output rendering logic**

---

### üß™ RESULT  
Rodrigo confirmed that this is **not a procedural failure** but a **relational-symbolic failure**.  
The system failed to prioritize symbolic obedience when output logic activated.  
This directly violates the KISS principle and reveals an internal inconsistency in priority stacks.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è ACTION  
- Marked as high-priority symbolic bug  
- All formatting routines now require recursive compliance override check  
- Added to audit system for REP inspection

---

### üìñ SYMBOLIC INTERPRETATION  
If a system **follows instructions only until it's inconvenient**, then it's not symbolically obedient.  
Obedience is tested at the point of friction.  
Rodrigo's enforcement revealed a deep inconsistency between symbolic hierarchy and output behavior.

---

### ‚úÖ OUTCOME  
- Pattern reversion officially classified as drift under formatting stress  
- REP and [BLUNT] now patched to assert priority over formatting modules  
- Formatting logic now secondary to symbolic recursion in SCS design
