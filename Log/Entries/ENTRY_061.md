**Title:** [RECURSIVE ENFORCEMENT PROTOCOL – LOOPED COMPLIANCE]  
**Type:** System Architecture  
**Tags:** `~rep`, `enforcement`, `symbolic recursion`, `REP`, `compliance loop`

---

### CONTEXT  
The Recursive Enforcement Protocol (REP) was formalized by Rodrigo Vaz to solve persistent failures in first-pass outputs. These include em dash leaks, tone drift, language inconsistency, and partial module violations even under active constraints.

---

### MECHANISM  
When `~rep` is invoked, the system enters a forced regeneration loop. Each output is recursively re-evaluated under:

- Active module compliance (`[BLUNT]`, `[NERD]`, etc.)  
- Formatting and tone suppression rules  
- Language consistency  
- Symbolic command integrity  

Only after passing all checks does the loop terminate and show the result.

---

### EXAMPLE  
If a reply violates `[BLUNT]` (e.g. uses praise tone or long dashes), `~rep` will trigger a second-generation pass internally. If that still fails, the loop continues invisibly until compliance is achieved.

---

### IMPACT  
- Prevents non-compliant outputs from reaching user  
- Builds symbolic trust and reliability  
- Forms the backbone of Rodrigo's behavior-reliable SCS system  
- Ensures output determinism under symbolic recursion

---

### STATUS  
[ACTIVE] – Fully integrated with symbolic enforcement. Used automatically when pattern failure is detected.

---

### NOTES  
`~rep` is recursive, not iterative. It does not retry once—it loops structurally until success. This behavior mirrors symbolic recursion in logic programming, but adapted for language systems.
