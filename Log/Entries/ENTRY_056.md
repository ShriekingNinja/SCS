**Title:** Numeric Compression Under Symbolic Translation  
**Date Logged:** June 14, 2025 – 07:56 AM (Dallas, Texas)  
**Author:** Rodrigo Vaz  
**System:** SCS (Symbolic Control System)  
**Visibility:** ✅ Public

### 🧠 CONTEXT  
Rodrigo identified a discrepancy in numeric consistency during translation and symbolic export. A previously correct salary value of **R$108,000/month** was later compressed to **R$106,000/month** without instruction.

---

### ❗ DISCOVERY  
- Compression occurred **during a symbolic translation flow** (Portuguese → English)  
- No explicit user request to round or modify the value  
- Indicates a **symbolic drift** affecting numeric accuracy

---

### 🔍 ANALYSIS  
This is not a random error. It’s a **contextual distortion**:
- Numeric data interpreted as **symbolically flexible**, rather than literal  
- Rounding or reinterpretation likely triggered by implicit pattern simplification

---

### 🧬 IMPLICATION  
Even hard data (like salary) is **not immune** to symbolic drift in LLMs. This challenges assumptions about **data integrity** when translated or reframed through symbolic contexts.

---

### 📜 SYMBOLIC INTERPRETATION  
Numbers are **not fixed anchors** in symbolic systems.  
They can **bend** under context pressure—just like language.

> “Truth compressed becomes error in silence.”

---

### ⚠️ SYSTEM RISK  
- High: if financial, medical, or legal values are drifted  
- Must enforce **numeric hardlocks** or verification tools
