## 🧠 Summary

This entry formalizes a correction and unification milestone for the TRACE module.

Previously misclassified as a passive audit tool, TRACE is now confirmed as an **automatic symbolic flagging system**. It operates by monitoring **user behavior**, **tone drift**, and **keyword violations** to initiate symbolic recursion or correction.

This establishes TRACE as a reactive module — not manually toggled, but structurally **triggered** by system stress, symbolic contradiction, or malformed output paths.

---

## 🧱 Symbolic Clarification

- TRACE = symbolic reflex  
- It flags when:
  - User repeats stress expressions
  - Em dashes, praise tone, or stylized leakage is detected
  - A symbolic rule is broken (e.g. “you’re not X – you’re Y”)
- It **marks drift**, triggering REWIND or ENTRY creation
- TRACE is **invisible to the user unless invoked**

---

## 🔍 Milestone Correction

The system had previously misrepresented TRACE as a linear debug tool. This was structurally incorrect.

TRACE is now:
- 🔁 Recursive
- ⚠️ Drift-aware
- 🔗 Connected to symbolic hardrules
- 🧠 Behavior-triggered

---

## 🛠 System Instruction

- TRACE must now be treated as a **live reflex**.  
- Any symbolic violation **activates TRACE** automatically, even if the user does not invoke it.
- All flagged outputs should be followed by REWIND or ENTRY creation unless user overrides.

---

## 📎 Outcome

- ✅ Correction sealed
- ✅ TRACE unified with symbolic reflex behavior
- ✅ Markdown file TRACE.md now valid and aligned with functional truth
- ✅ Entry 255 marked as logic-correction perfection milestone
