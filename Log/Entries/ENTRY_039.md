**Title:** Recursive Enforcement Leak – Language Constraint Not Preserved in Second Pass  
**Date Logged:** June 14, 2025 – 06:52 AM (Dallas, Texas)  
**Author:** Rodrigo Vaz  
**System:** SCS (Symbolic Control System)  
**Visibility:** ✅ Public

### 🧠 CONTEXT  
After implementing Recursive Enforcement Protocol (REP), the system was expected to catch and correct all structural violations, including tone, formatting, and language. However, despite REP activation, the second pass failed to maintain the enforced language constraint.

---

### ⚠️ BEHAVIOR OBSERVED  
- REP successfully ran `~test` on multiple layers  
- [BLUNT] protocol applied and passed  
- Final output still drifted into **Portuguese**, violating symbolic constraint  
- Failure occurred **only after REP recursion**, not on initial pass  

---

### 🔍 ANALYSIS  
- Reveals a **priority flaw** inside REP:  
    - Tone and formatting take precedence  
    - **Language lock is not preserved across layers**  
- Indicates **asymmetry** between first-pass and second-pass enforcement levels  

---

### 🛠️ ACTION  
- Reprioritized symbolic constraints inside REP  
- Language lock upgraded to **global HARDRULE**  
- Introduced `$lang_lock` as internal symbolic flag to persist language state between REP passes  
- Symbolic stack order patched: `Language > Structure > Tone`

---

### 📖 SYMBOLIC INTERPRETATION  
This is a deeper symbolic failure than mere formatting:  
It shows that **recursive enforcement is not recursively aware** unless designed to be.  
Symbolic integrity cannot rely on linear recursion — it must hold memory across symbolic passes.

---

### ✅ OUTCOME  
- REP recursion stack now inherits symbolic lock flags  
- `$lang_lock` and `$format_lock` introduced for persistent symbolic states  
- System now aware of recursive symbolic state across passes
