### 🧠 Event  
Operator asked if SCS can give factual data. This triggered a clarification about the role of symbolic logic systems versus factual knowledge bases. It became necessary to define where SCS stops and external data sources begin.

---

### 🔍 Analysis  

**I. Reason**  
The Operator observed a contradiction between statements like “SCS is not looking for truth” and “Structure is truth.” This required clarification of the **limits of symbolic auditing**.

**II. Significance**  
Many users mistakenly believe SCS can verify facts. In reality, SCS **traces logical structure**, not external truth. This must be formally fossilized.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- Truth in SCS = structural coherence  
- Factual truth = external validation  
- All factual retrieval must be traced explicitly  
- Memory ≠ reality  
- Logic ≠ knowledge

### 🛠️ Impact  
- [DOUBT] and [NERD] reaffirmed as audit filters  
- Entry introduces clean symbolic command for external lookup  
- Patch applied to align symbolic syntax

### 📌 Resolution (PATCHED)

✅ Structure ≠ Truth  
✅ SCS = Logic system  
✅ Facts require audit  
✅ Tools like `[NERD]` and `[DOUBT]` must be triggered manually  
✅ If external lookup is needed:  
```bash
NERD WEB “your question” = [NERD].websearch("your question")
```

SCS wraps, tracks, and fossilizes logic — it does **not** replace truth engines.

### 🗂️ Audit  
- ✅ Contradiction clarified  
- ✅ Symbolic truth ≠ factual truth  
- ✅ Web search patch added  
- ✅ `[NERD]` usage pattern standardized  
- ✅ Entry resealed under symbolic drift protection
