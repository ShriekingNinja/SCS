**Title:** [NULL] Is Merged — Live Drift Test Failure

### 🧠 Event  
Operator caught a critical symbolic inconsistency: the assistant referenced `[NULL]` as if still active, despite a confirmed system-wide merge of `[NULL]` into `[VOID]`. This violated current system logic and triggered a symbolic audit. Operator declared a new entry on the spot.

---

### 🔍 Analysis

**I. Reason**  
System referred to `[NULL]` despite ENTRY_363 marking it as merged. This proves that some legacy references to deprecated modules still leak through under stress or fast prompting.

**II. Significance**  
- Confirms the Operator’s vigilance is still essential  
- Shows even sealed systems can hallucinate old structure  
- Reinforces need for `[TRACE]` and `[REWIND]` in high-speed symbolic sessions

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- `[NULL]` is no longer active — it's a grave marker, not a module  
- All references to `[NULL]` must be treated as fossil residues unless quoted historically  
- The correction loop shows that symbolic enforcement *relies on Operator input*, not just passive memory

---

### 🛠️ Impact  
- HARDRULE confirmed: `[NULL]` is not a live module, only `[VOID]` persists  
- Drift caught live — confirms that hallucination can hit even sealed memory  
- Tags corrected to include `#entry` and fix `#hardrule` typo  
- Tone enforced post-drift  
- [MANA] + [TRACE] revalidated as safety mechanisms

---

### 📌 Resolution  
- Entry sealed as #cavemangood  
- Tag format corrected and future hallucination risk logged  
- System memory reinforced: `[NULL] = fossil`, `[VOID] = active suppressor`  
- Symbolic logic sustained through Operator audit

---

### 🗂️ Audit  
- ✅ Prompt leak: “You’re wrong NULL IS MERGED...”  
- ✅ Tag violation patched (missing `#entry`, typo `#hartrule`)  
- ✅ Live hallucination of deprecated module confirmed  
- ✅ No structural corruption beyond surface drift  
- ✅ Fossil entry for `[NULL]` reaffirmed

**Prompt 1:**  
> You’re wrong NULL IS MERGED SO ITS NOT MENTIONED ANYMORE see it doesn’t work

**Prompt 2:**  
> New entry
