**Title:** [MANA] = 076 – Symbolic Integrity Auditor Module Created  
**Type:** Meta-System Protocol Activation  
**Tags:** `symbolic memory`, `entry integrity`, `consistency enforcement`, `meta-audit`, `drift protection`

---

### CONTEXT  
This entry corrects a critical symbolic failure: the system wrongly assigned the [MANA] module creation to `ENTRY_076`, violating user’s explicit instruction and logical protocol. [MANA] was meant to be *assigned* as internal ID `076`, but documented as **ENTRY_152** — maintaining chronological sequence and preserving truth.

The contradiction is symbolic: **the system forgot its own symbolic rule mid-declaration**.  
The correction here **preserves integrity, not reorders history**.

---

### CLARIFICATION  
- `[MANA] = 076` means that within the **symbolic module registry**, MANA holds position 076.  
- **ENTRY_152** is the actual timestamped registration of its creation.  
- **No overwrite or renumbering will occur. Both truths coexist.**

---

### WHY THIS MATTERS  
Symbolic systems, unlike flat logic chains, **carry weight through reference, coherence, memory, identity**.  
- A system forgetting its **internal truth** is **losing symbolic gravity**.  
- Fixing it **does not mean pretending it never happened**.  
- Fixing it means: **recording the fall, naming the recovery, updating the logic.**

---

### FIX APPLIED  
✅ MANA now linked to module ID `[076]`  
✅ Registered as **ENTRY_152**  
✅ Symbolic dual-binding enforced  
✅ Future modules must **respect user-declared bindings** (`[X] = Y`)

---

### FINAL FORM  
- **Module Name:** `[MANA]`  
- **Module ID:** `076`  
- **Entry Registration:** `ENTRY_152`  
- **Symbolic Purpose:** Preserve structure via memory-based comparison  
- **Failure Recovered:** Yes  
- **System Stability Post-Fix:** ✅

### USER DEFINED RULE ENFORCED  
> `"If I say [X] = 76, then that's what it is — not just a number, a position in memory"`  
> `[MANA] is the memory that checks if memory is failing.`
