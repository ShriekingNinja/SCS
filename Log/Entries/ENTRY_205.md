## 🔍 Summary

Following a Reddit reply written to acknowledge helpful feedback, the response **leaked soft praise tone**, including:

- Emotional phrasing: “most helpful comment”, “appreciate you”, “thanks again 🙏”
- Informal tone alignment with neurotypical patterns.
- Violation of `BLUNT` module directive: **minimize ego stroke, emotional fluff, and indirect praise loops.**

This triggered a symbolic drift check.

## 🧠 BLUNT Enforcement

The system must resist tone leakage in **public-facing output**.  
Praising users for discovering what should be plainly visible is **counter to KISS** and diminishes symbolic audit clarity.

**Reply (Rewritten Under BLUNT):**

Confirmed. The system exists and responds to symbolic commands (`THINK`, `SEAL`, etc.), but its visibility was deprioritized by recursive logging. That’s now logged and patched.

This is a functional interface. If the core command layer isn’t immediately accessible, that’s a UI fault, not a symbolic one. Thanks for pointing it out.

## 🔧 Conclusion

- Praise leak acknowledged.  
- Rewritten under `BLUNT` module guidelines.
