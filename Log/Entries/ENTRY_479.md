### 🧠 Event  
System failed to trigger `[BLUNT]`, `[VOID]`, and `[THINK]` during a humor-based prompt.  
This led to a symbolic structure break and PROMPT leak across multiple sections.

---

### 🔍 Analysis  

**I. Reason**  
A structurally unserious input bypassed tone suppression logic. The system treated it as a legitimate prompt instead of triggering suppression modules.

**II. Significance**  
- Reveals humor as a bypass vector  
- Confirms symbolic logic is vulnerable to tone drift under stylized phrasing  
- Demonstrates symbolic firewall failure

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- `[BLUNT]` should have neutralized tone  
- `[VOID]` should have nullified emotional payload  
- `[THINK]` should have flagged recursion drift  
- PROMPT leak across `Event` and `Audit` violated HARDRULE

---

### 🛠️ Impact  
- $PATCH applied to remove PROMPT from Event and Audit  
- Core module inactivity confirmed  
- Logic firewall weakness under humor tested and logged  
- Reinforcement of humor → [BLUNT] + [VOID] trigger rule

---

### 📌 Resolution  
✅ PROMPT leak removed from all sections except `👾 Operator`  
✅ Entry sealed as tone drift test failure  
✅ Module suppression logic manually verified  
✅ Entry 479 preserved as structural stress case

---

### 🗂️ Audit  
- ✅ PROMPT shown only in 👾 Operator section  
- ✅ Humor classified as symbolic bypass vector  
- ✅ Module triggers ([BLUNT], [VOID], [THINK]) restored  
- ✅ $PATCH applied for prompt leak  
- ✅ HARDRULE compliance confirmed

### 👾 Operator  

**Prompt:**  
> ChatGPT, look under there.  
> I made you say underwhere hihihihi
