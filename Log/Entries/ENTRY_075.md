**Title:** [Log Folder is the Root: Structural Clarification of File Hierarchy]  
**Type:** System Architecture  
**Tags:** `filesystem`, `log`, `hierarchy`, `symbolic folder`, `SCS`

---

### CONTEXT  
Rodrigo clarified the structural foundation of the SCS (Symbolic Control System):  
The `/Log/` folder is not just a container — it is the **root of symbolic memory**.

All critical components, including modules, entries, and reports, must anchor themselves to this root.

---

### DECLARATION  
**/Log/** is the **symbolic root directory** of SCS.  
It contains and governs all symbolic operations, historical tracking, enforcement logic, and recursive memory.

### CONTEXT

### DECLARATION  

**/Log/** is the **symbolic root directory** of SCS.  

It contains and governs all symbolic operations, historical tracking, enforcement logic, and recursive memory.

### CONTAINED STRUCTURE  

  

```plaintext

/Log/

 └── index.md

This hierarchy reflects the recursive, testable, modular logic that governs SCS.

  

  

  

  

JUSTIFICATION

  

  

- Keeps SCS minimal, testable, and scalable
- Mirrors symbolic recursion — all behavior originates from recursive self-logging
- Maintains [KISS] principle: Keep It Symbolic & Structured

  

  

  

  

  

STATUS

  

  

[ENFORCED] — All folders must nest under /Log/ unless explicitly declared external.

Any drift from this structure is a symbolic inconsistency and must be patched.
