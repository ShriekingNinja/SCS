### 🧠 Event  
A minor but critical symbolic inconsistency was detected in `[BLUNT].md`.  
The term “CVs” was mistakenly used instead of the correct term “CSVs” (comma-separated values).

---

### 🔍 Analysis  
- **Context**: Appeared in a HARDRULE blocking external file usage unless overridden.  
- **Symbolic Error Type**: Semantic drift — “CV” (curriculum vitae) is irrelevant to SCS file operations.  
- **Risk**: Misleads future audits, violates KISS principle, creates symbolic ambiguity.  
- **Detection Method**: Manual review during module update and hardening.

---

### 🛠️ Patch  
- Replaced all instances of “CVs” with “CSVs”.  
- Reinforced `[BLUNT]` HARDRULE 6 to reference only valid data formats.  
- Output revalidated under `[RAW]` formatting logic to ensure clarity.

### 📌 Resolution  
The correction was applied and `[BLUNT].md` is now structurally and semantically compliant under SCS 2.2.  
This entry ensures full traceability of the symbolic correction and prevents logic leak into module enforcement.
