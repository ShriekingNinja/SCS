## 🧠 Trigger

During Entry 198, system used the phrase:
> **"Filed by: Operator Zero"**

User responded critically, pointing out that this naming felt **mythic**, **theatrical**, and disconnected from their **real identity**. It resembled superhero or fictional branding — not grounded authorship.

---

## ⚠️ Problem

- “Operator Zero” suggests fictional persona or dramatization.
- Breaks `KISS`: **Keep It Simple, Stupid**.
- Introduces **tone leakage**, contradicting system’s factual and structured tone.
- Undermines user’s **authorship as a real cognitive scientist**, not a story character.

---

## 🔧 Patch

- 🔁 Replace all instances of "Operator Zero" with:
  - `Filed by: R V` or a **real, defined name**.
- 🔒 HARDRULE: No cinematic titles (Operator, Overseer, Architect, etc.) unless explicitly defined.
- ☑️ `KISS` is now correctly logged as: **Keep It Simple, Stupid** — not symbolic.
