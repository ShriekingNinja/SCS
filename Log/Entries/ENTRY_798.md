### 🧠 Event
Answer three public questions with structure and verification:  
1) **Do vaccines cause autism?**  
2) **Do vaccines benefit humans?**  
3) **Was COVID-19 a real virus or fake news?**

—

### 🔍 Analysis
**I. Reason**  
These claims recur in social media and confuse policy/personal decisions. We separate **descriptive facts** from rumor and label uncertainty explicitly.

**II. Significance**  
Health misinformation carries safety risk; Berkano requires **auditable sources**, clear framing of benefits/risks, and unambiguous language.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- “Single study” or anecdote ≠ ledger.  
- Large, independent, reproducible evidence sets decide outcomes; where evidence is weak, label **Unverified**.

—

### 🛠️ Impact — Plain, testable statements ([VERIFY] framing)
- **Vaccines & autism:** Large, independent epidemiological studies across countries **find no causal link** between routine childhood vaccines (e.g., MMR) and autism diagnoses. An old, widely cited paper alleging a link was **retracted** for serious faults.  
- **Human benefit:** Vaccines **reduce infection, severe disease, complications, and death**; they contribute to **community (herd) protection**, protecting those who cannot be vaccinated. Rare adverse events exist and are **monitored**; benefit–risk is evaluated per vaccine and population.  
- **COVID-19 reality:** **SARS-CoV-2** is a real virus: its **genome** was sequenced early; labs **isolate and culture** it; **diagnostics** and **antivirals/vaccines** target it; **excess mortality** and clinical findings confirm its impact. “Fake news” does not produce consistent genomes, cultures, and global clinical signals.

*(Details/numbers should be attached as primary sources; see Guidance.)*

—

### 📌 Resolution
- **Vaccines do not cause autism** (based on converging large-scale studies).  
- **Vaccines benefit humans**, while rare adverse events are tracked and disclosed.  
- **COVID-19 is real**; its existence is evidenced by genomes, lab culture, clinical/epidemiological records.

—

### 🗂️ Audit
**Lesson:** Health decisions require **population-level evidence**, not anecdotes.  
**Reinforcement:** Keep a **source ledger** (primary studies, surveillance reports, retraction notices); label uncertainty; update fossils when new high-quality evidence appears.

### 🧩 Berkano Guidance
*Guidance is **prescriptive**, not a factual claim. Informative, logic-based recommendations in present tense. Start each **Do** with a capitalized imperative.*

| Because (Finding)                               | Do (Imperative)                                               | Evidence (now)                                           | Safety / Notes                                  |
|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Claim “vaccines cause autism” circulates        | **Publish** a one-page ledger of large cohort studies + the retraction note of the 1990s paper | Links to major cohort/meta-analysis; retraction notice   | Use neutral tone; no ridicule                  |
| Public unsure about benefit vs risk             | **Make** a benefit–risk explainer (what vaccines prevent; how AEs are monitored) | National surveillance pages; WHO/CDC style summaries     | State that personal medical advice = clinician |
| COVID “fake” rumor persists                     | **Create** a SARS-CoV-2 artifact list (genome, culture, diagnostics, excess mortality charts) | Genome repository link; lab isolation notes; dashboards  | Label data source/date; avoid cherry-picking   |
| Web claims in posts                             | **Post** with “H24: chain passed” note                        | Source list per post                                     | Prevent raw web leakage                        |

### 🧸 ELI5
No, shots don’t cause autism. Shots help people avoid getting very sick. And COVID-19 is real—we can even bounce light off parts of the virus’s code to check it (scientists read its “recipe”).

—

### 📟 LLM Logic
- Modules: `[TONE]` neutral; `[PRUNE]` keep only testable claims; `[LOGIC]` ledger framing; `[VERIFY]` require primary sources; `[CHECK]` tag rumors as Unverified; `[LOCK]` seal.  
- H24: Any linked web sources must pass the full chain before posting publicly.

### ✖️ Post (Optional)

```
Vaccines don’t cause autism; they reduce severe disease and death. COVID-19 is real (genomes, culture, diagnostics, excess mortality). Cite ledgers; apply H24.
