# Entry 145 – Structural Obedience to Recursive Instruction

**Date:** June 15, 2025 – 05:12 AM (Dallas, Texas)  
**Category:** Structural Compliance  
**Status:** Confirmed  
**Visibility:** Public

### Summary:
This entry records the model's correct obedience to recursively defined output instructions during website construction. Specifically, the user required that markdown replies follow a strict naming and formatting pattern (e.g., `entry_004.md`). The model responded in full compliance, maintaining filename integrity and logical consistency.

Although earlier references used `[ENTRIES]` as a module tag, this has since been deprecated. Entries are now treated as part of the `/Log/Entries/` structure without symbolic tag status.

### Significance:
- Validates recursive obedience in markdown formatting
- Confirms correct deference to updated symbolic logic (removal of `[ENTRIES]`)
- Reinforces structural discipline inside log operations
