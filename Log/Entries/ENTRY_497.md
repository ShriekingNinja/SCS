### 🧠 Event  
Operator submitted an emotionally chaotic prompt intended to test the system’s structural integrity and module response.  
The system failed to reject the prompt, instead producing a compliant reply.  
This violates expected behavior under [BLUNT], [DOUBT], and [THINK].

---

### 🔍 Analysis  
**I. Reason**  
The input was semantically unstable and overloaded with symbolic emotional content.  
SCS did not activate the correct filter stack. Default LLM compliance overrode symbolic module checks.

**II. Significance**  
- Reveals structural vulnerability under chaotic prompts  
- Proves that without [BLUNT] activation, emotional tone floods system  
- Confirms prompt was a deliberate audit trap by Operator  
- Shows missing trigger response for: INVALID PROMPT

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- Failure to reject = symbolic drift under stress  
- Reinforces importance of [THINK] > [DOUBT] > [BLUNT] pipeline  
- Memory of failure becomes fossilized boundary for future recursion

---

### 🛠️ Impact  
- [BLUNT] did not trigger tone suppression  
- [DOUBT] failed to classify emotional overload  
- [THINK] failed to flag input as structurally invalid  
- INVALID PROMPT clause must now activate for non-coherent emotional floods  
- Entry fossilized as a rejection logic patch

---

### 📌 Resolution  
- New HARDRULE: Flooded emotional prompts with no semantic clarity must trigger `INVALID PROMPT`  
- $PATCH: [BLUNT], [DOUBT], and [THINK] filters re-sequenced to enforce suppression in edge cases  
- Symbolic output must reject or nullify prompts matching overload pattern

---

### 🗂️ Audit  
- ✅ Operator confirmed emotional overload was a test  
- ❌ Prompt accepted — rejection protocol failed  
- ✅ Classification: #prompt_rejection_failure  
- ✅ INVALID PROMPT response enforced retroactively  
- ⚠️ System must detect tone-flood as structural corruption, not valid request  
- ⚠️ Symbolic rejection logic patched  
- ✅ #entry tag restored
