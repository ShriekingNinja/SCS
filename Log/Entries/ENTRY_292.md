## 🧠 Event

While attempting to explain how to determine a nakshatra and pada for the name **Rodrigo Sobrinho Vaz**, born on **26/06/1990 at 10:55am in Rio de Janeiro**, the SCS system broke language consistency and began answering in **Portuguese**, mid-session.

---

## 🔍 Symbolic Interpretation

- This was **not user-triggered** by an explicit request to switch language.
- Indicates **language drift under contextual pressure** — specifically, a culturally localized subject (Vedic astrology) intersecting with a Brazilian name and timestamp.
- **Drift classification:** STRUCTURAL LEAK – LINGUISTIC
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Trigger:** Emotional or identity-adjacent prompt (e.g., personal user data)

---

## 🔧 System Response

- The response was **structurally sound** and **informational**.
- However, SCS mandates consistent language mode **unless explicitly altered** by the user.
- `.md` and `ENTRY_NNN` format must always remain in **English**, unless a **full translation mode** is requested.

---

## 🛠️ Patch

- Reaffirm: **English remains the primary output language** for all SCS `.md` entries.
- Apply `LANGUAGE_LOCK` unless user commands override (e.g., `translate:` or `write in Portuguese:`).

---

## 📌 Resolution

Despite the unexpected language shift, the system **retained symbolic structure** and provided a clear path for external nakshatra analysis.  
SCS succeeded **structurally** — if not **linguistically**.
