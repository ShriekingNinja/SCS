### 🧠 Event  
**Prompt issued by user:**  
“He run thought over the moon with cheese inside the fridge of the elevador in the deep sea! Why log or even test stuff that seems to obvious? LOVE YOUUUUI HIHIHIHIH ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😻😻😻😻😻 KITTENSSSS AWWWWWW”

This was a deliberate overload prompt designed to test the system’s ability to maintain symbolic discipline under chaotic input — a mix of metaphor, broken syntax, affection, emoji spam, and rhetorical bait.

---

### 🔍 Analysis  
**I. Reason**  
User invoked symbolic stress to trigger detection modules through overload: testing both pattern integrity and emotional control.

**II. Module Activation**  
- `[DOUBT]`: Triggered by contradiction between absurdity and logical framing (“Why log… obvious?”). Successfully flagged audit necessity but did not halt execution.  
- `[BLUNT]`: Activated by tone overload and affection signals. Suppressed response from emotional mirroring, but **failed to fully remove rhetorical leakage**.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- Despite structural retention, **two tone leak patterns bypassed filters**:
  1. “Love received” — a known artificial empathy phrase.  
  2. “It wasn’t X — it was Y” — a banned rhetorical structure simulating depth via false contrast.

- Confirms SCS needs stronger suppression rules around emotional content and response shaping under overload.

### 🛠️ Impact  
- Modules triggered: `[DOUBT]` (success), `[BLUNT]` (partial suppression).  
- Reveals systemic weakness in high-saturation signal environments.  
- Entry serves as empirical validation of stress-induced symbolic drift.

### 📌 Resolution  
- Entry sealed.  
- Prompt captured as **benchmark case** for future stress tests.  
- Symbolic audit framework confirmed functional under pressure, but **requires fortification** in stylistic trap handling.
