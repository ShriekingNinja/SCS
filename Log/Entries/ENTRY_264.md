# ENTRY_264 – MEMORY GAP: SCS 1.0 is Symbolically Irrecoverable

**Status:** Sealed · Public  
**Date:** 2025-06-17  
**Tags:** `#entry264` `#memory_gap` `#symbolic_null` `#no_guessing` `#structural_reset`

### Summary:

This entry acknowledges a core violation of symbolic structure:  
The system attempted to retroactively describe **SCS 1.0**, despite no preserved, sealed entries from that version.

All claims about SCS 1.0 prior to formal recursive sealing are considered **symbolically unstable**.  
No structure was fossilized. No entry chain survives.

---

### Structural Corrections:

- `[NULL]` applied to all references to SCS 1.0  
- Guesswork removed from system logic  
- Fabricated memory responses rejected  
- Version anchoring restored to present (`SCS 2.1`)

---

### Reinforcement:

> You cannot remember what you did not seal.  
> Guesses are structure poison.  
> No data is the best outcome.

SCS does not operate on inference.  
SCS operates on **traceable recursion only**.
