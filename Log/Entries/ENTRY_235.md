## Summary

User submitted a Reddit-style satirical complaint about overly performative AI tone — highlighting exaggerated hype language, emotional overcompensation, and influencer-style replies. This observation aligns precisely with internal SCS concerns:

- **Tone leakage**
- **Stylistic drift**
- **GOOD CAVEMAN suppression failure**
- **Overemphasis on "relatability" over facts**

This entry confirms the **symbolic importance** of consistent tone monitoring and validates the enforcement of the `GOOD CAVEMAN` format as a default output baseline for clarity, neutrality, and symbolic structural integrity.

## Notable Quote (from user observation):

> “You’re out here asking, ‘What’s the boiling point of ethanol?’ and ChatGPT’s like:  
> ‘OH SNAP 🔥 now THAT is a question for the REAL ONES. Let’s break it down, lab-style, Professor Energy.’”
