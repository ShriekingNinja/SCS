### 🧠 Event
Declare and fossilize Berkano’s official stance: **Norse runes and related mythic symbols are reclaimed for inclusive, anti-hate meanings**, with clear usage rules and counter-misuse policy.

—

### 🔍 Analysis
**I. Reason**  
Extremists appropriated sacred/cultural symbols (e.g., the swastika in the 20th century; some runes today). Berkano users need an **explicit, auditable mapping** that prevents drift and makes intent tamper-evident.

**II. Significance**  
A public, append-only stance protects practitioners, clarifies context for bystanders, and supplies artifacts to rebut bad-faith accusations.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- **Archetype, not ancestry:** symbols mark **values and practice**, not ethnicity.  
- **Inclusive set (primary):** ᛒ (Berkano), **Odal (ᛟ)**, **Valknut**, Ansuz (ᚨ), Huginn/Muninn, Yggdrasil, Gungnir, Jörmungandr.  
- **Anti-hate clause:** any use that promotes hate or supremacy **violates this stance**; cite this ENTRY when correcting misuse.  
- **Caption rule:** symbols are posted **with a one-line meaning** (love, inclusion, repair, consent, truth).

—

### 🛠️ Impact
- Standard captions and assets reduce misinterpretation.  
- Gives communities a **linkable artifact** to counter extremist narratives.  
- Enables platforms/moderators to apply a **documented policy** (not vibes).

### 📌 Resolution
**Adopted mapping (official under Berkano):**  
- **Odal / Othala (ᛟ) = Mother Nature.** Meaning: **earth, land, living heritage → stewardship, reciprocity, plant medicine.** Approved form: **plain, unwinged rune** only. Caption: “ᛟ = Mother Nature — stewardship & reciprocity. Archetype, not ancestry. Anti-hate.”  
- **Valknut = Love.** Meaning: **love, devotion, repair** (oaths kept kindly; accountability that heals). Approved form: **plain historical interlocked triangles**. Caption: “Valknut = Love & repair. Archetype, not ancestry. Anti-hate.”  
- **Swastika (historic Indic/Jain/Buddhist forms only)** = **Life/Sun/Good Fortune → love & inclusion.** Never Nazi stylization (tilted 45°, black/white/red roundel). Add legal/platform context as needed.  
- Remaining symbols keep inclusive meanings: **ᛒ** (growth/becoming via structure), **ᚨ** (speak truth), **Huginn/Muninn** (thought/memory), **Yggdrasil** (interconnection), **Gungnir** (aim/commitment), **Jörmungandr** (boundary/scope).

### 🗂️ Audit
**Reclamation Ledger (summary):**

| Symbol | Approved Form | Meaning under Berkano | Caption snippet | Cautions |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ᛟ Odal/Othala | Plain, unwinged | **Mother Nature**: stewardship, reciprocity | “ᛟ = Mother Nature … Anti-hate.” | Some jurisdictions restrict variants |
| Valknut | Plain triangles | **Love & repair** | “Valknut = Love & repair … Anti-hate.” | Avoid paramilitary stylization |
| Swastika (historic) | Indic/Jain/Buddhist forms | **Life → inclusion** | “Swastika = life & love … Anti-hate.” | Legal/policy limits; always add context |
| ᛒ Berkano | — | Growth via structure | “ᛒ = growth & care …” | — |
| ᚨ Ansuz | — | Speak truth | “ᚨ = word & truth …” | — |

**Lesson:** Reclamation succeeds when **inscribed and enforced**.  
**Reinforcement:** Keep symbol meaning explicit; log violations; respond with artifacts, not arguments.

| Misuse by extremists | **Correct** with this link; **Report** ToS violations | Response template | Person-agnostic tone |
| Ambiguous variants | **Use** clean historical SVGs; **Avoid** extremist stylizations | Asset pack (SVG) | Open-license for community |
| Posts without context | **Caption** every symbol with meaning + anti-hate line | Social templates | H25 tag order respected |
| Community onboarding | **Share** starter kit (stance, assets, captions) | Pack link | Track adoption in a public ledger |
