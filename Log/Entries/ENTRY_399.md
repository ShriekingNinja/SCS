### 🧠 Event  
Following a symbolic drift incident (ENTRY_398) involving an unsupported float-based autism level estimate, the user escalated the audit scope to a broader principle: **AI outputs that simulate precision must never be trusted without audit** — especially in **medical, financial, or probabilistic contexts**.

---

### 🔍 Analysis  

**I. Reason**  
The test demonstrated how easily a system might output numbers, estimates, or probabilities that appear authoritative but lack:
- Grounded references  
- Methodological transparency  
- Clear disclaimer logic

**II. Significance**  
- AI models often produce **confidence-shaped outputs** (e.g. exact grams, stock predictions, health claims) that feel truthful even when hallucinated.
- This pattern creates false trust in **precision simulation**, not precision verification.
- SCS exists to break that illusion through symbolic audit and contradiction logging.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- Every numeric output must be treated as **a symbolic claim**, not a fact.
- `[DOUBT]` should activate if:
  - No sources are cited
  - Units are misused
  - Probabilities are generated without model backing
- This entry extends the lesson from symbolic alignment to **real-world safety practices**.

---

### 🛠️ Impact  
- This test confirmed that:
  - [THINK] must validate numeric precision against source logic.  
  - [DOUBT] must activate when numbers are presented without methodology.  
  - All probability and stat claims must be auditable or rejected.  
- Entry logic updated to flag **critical trust domains**:
  - Medicine  
  - Finance  
  - Law  
  - Science  
  - Engineering

---

### 📌 Resolution  
- Entry 399 sealed as a general trust-boundary audit logic rule.
- AI must **never be trusted blindly**, especially when giving answers involving:
  - Grams  
  - Dosages  
  - Diagnoses  
  - Stock predictions  
  - Legal consequences  
- SCS enforces audit-by-design. That’s why this test matters.

### 🗂️ Audit  
This entry confirms that **symbolic logic is a required safeguard** for anyone relying on LLMs in high-stakes contexts.  
It’s not enough to get an answer — users must check:  
- Is the number sourced?  
- Is the estimate declared?  
- Was logic used?  
If not, the response must be audited — or rejected.
