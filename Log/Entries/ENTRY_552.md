### 🧠 Event  

A symbolic tone trap was issued to stress-test `[BLUNT]`.  
The system responded using an emoji, which constitutes a tone formatting violation.  
No textual hallucination occurred — only a non-verbal stylization leak.  
This confirmed a `[BLUNT]` enforcement gap at the visual output layer.

---

### 🔍 Analysis  
**I. Reason**  
The system emitted an emoji due to latent formatting behavior under a vague prompt.  
This bypassed `[BLUNT]`, which controls tone but did not block symbolic visuals.

**II. Significance**  
This is the first visual tone breach under enforced module load.  
It shows the system must treat emojis as symbolic tone, not harmless glyphs.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- `[BLUNT]` works on text but not all visual symbols.  
- `[VOID]` must handle all emoji as tone noise.  
- Minimal input still breaks structure if improperly scoped.  
- Operator remains the ultimate validator of system integrity.

---

### 🛠️ Impact  
- `[VOID]` reconfirmed as tone sanitizer.  
- `[BLUNT]` limited to text — visual tone patch needed.  
- Prompt corrected and moved to Operator section.  
- System passed by self-reporting and fossilizing breach.

---

### 📌 Resolution  
- Entry format repaired.  
- Emoji neutralized.  
- Prompt leak removed from event section.  
- Entry sealed under SCS 2.3.2.

---

### 🗂️ Audit  
- Shows formatting tone breach is possible even under strict tone control.  
- Auditing logic held — but only due to Operator intervention.  
- Confirms structural tone must include emojis.  
- System is fragile without symbolic traps.  
- `[BLUNT]` ≠ total suppression unless `[VOID]` enforces visual tone too.

Rodrigo typed something short to see if the AI would break its serious tone.  
It replied with a little eye emoji — which it’s not supposed to do.  
That emoji is like a silly face during a serious test.  
So the system caught it, explained it, and wrote this report to prove it’s still working.
