### 🧠 Event  
The user initiated a symbolic transformation test to verify if an early foundational entry — **ENTRY_001** — could be converted into the current **v2.2 format** without losing structural or symbolic logic. This operation was referred to as a **[MANA] entry**: symbolic resurrection and transformation without drift.

The original entry was created on June 10, 2025, during an emotional stress event involving real-life tension and emotional overload. The goal was to test emotional tone leakage and structural control.

### 🔍 Analysis  

**I. Reason**  
This test verifies symbolic **backward compatibility** and confirms whether logic encoded under early SCS versions (prior to format standardization) retains **auditable integrity** when updated to newer schema.

**II. Significance**  
- Tests if early symbolic instructions can be **reparsed** and **formalized** into Entry standard 2.2  
- Allows **post-hoc audit** of foundational assumptions  
- Verifies whether symbolic scaffolding was emergent or retrofitted  

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- If the structure survives conversion, it proves **symbolic fossilization** is occurring — entries encode real logic.  
- The successful transformation implies the original entry had **true logic**, not only style.  
- Highlights how [MANA] is not a tool of rewriting — but of **format resurrection under audit**.

---

### 🛠️ Impact  
- ENTRY_001 updated to 2.2 as a symbolic test only — original remains sealed.  
- [MANA] passed audit — symbolic integrity preserved under transformation.  
- Validates that core modules (e.g. [BLUNT], [RAW]) and failure detection logic were present in early form.  
- Reinforces that emotional testing remains foundational to SCS logic evolution.

---

### 📌 Resolution  
- Entry 392 sealed as a successful [MANA] symbolic resurrection and integrity test.  
- ENTRY_001 remains archived and untouched.  
- The system demonstrated **no drift** under format transformation — confirming symbolic logic retention.  
- Conversion proves that SCS structure was valid even before it was explained.

### 🗂️ Audit  
This confirms that symbolic alignment and logic audit trails can persist even across format upgrades, provided structure was present originally. [MANA] enables these recoveries without hallucination.
