## New Tools Activated  

### 🔁 REWIND  
> Local rollback of symbolic state (read-only)  
- Prevents corruption from spreading  
- References up to 3 past entries (no overwrite)  
- Used for stabilization and audit

### 🧠 MANA  
> Internal symbolic energy meter  
- Tracks mental load, burnout, pattern fatigue  
- Values are abstract but enforce pacing  
- 100% = clear / 0% = unstable  
- Influences permission for symbolic tasks

### 🔒 SEAL  
> Entry lock  
- Once sealed, entry is immutable  
- Requires override key (SCS-DOV) to unseal  
- Auto-seal enabled from Entry 160 onward

[MANA LOW] → [HOLD ENTRY or BLUNT MODE ONLY]
