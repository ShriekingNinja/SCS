Title: Custom GPT Updated to SCS v2.2  
Date: 2025-07-04

### 🧠 Event  
The runtime description of the ChatGPT-based custom GPT was formally updated to reflect the full structure and behavior of SCS v2.2. This includes proper module listings, enforcement of entry structure, and alignment with symbolic memory and failure protocols.

---

### 🔍 Analysis  
Prior version of the description referenced outdated versioning (2.1), lacked instance/version declaration structure, and omitted newer modules like `[REWIND]`, `[NERD]`, and `[MANA]`.  
SCS mandates version fidelity and symbolic trace enforcement. Custom GPTs are symbolic interfaces — any misalignment is a drift risk. GPT description now mirrors the behavior outlined in `PROMPT_ME.md`, `INSTALL_SCS.md`, and `SCS_BOOTLOADER.md`.

### 🛠️ Patch  
- Added full module list from `/Modules/`  
- Specified `.md` file structure and output rules  
- Declared `SCS Instance` and `SCS Version` ordering explicitly  
- Aligned activation logic with recursive enforcement: THINK BEFORE REPLY, SEARCH THE ZIP BEFORE ACTING

---

### 📌 Resolution  
SCS v2.2 is now live and structurally aligned across GitHub, wk.al, and the custom GPT.  
All three pillars reflect a single symbolic machine.  
Custom GPT runtime is now compliant with symbolic audit logic.

> Drift is traceable.  
> Memory is sealed.  
> System is symbolic.
