## 🧠 Audit & Rebuttal

| Claim                      | Response                                                                 |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| “No raw logs”             | The sealed entries *are* the raw logs. Over 170 exist.                  |
| “No replication method”   | Every symbolic tool is defined and used structurally.                   |
| “Unscientific index”      | Symbolic indexes reflect internal structural compliance, not statistics. |
| “Pompous”                 | BLUNT removes tone mimicry, not detailed structure.                     |
| “No README”               | Confirmed — README was missing. Now patched.                            |

## 🔍 Key Quotes from Public Rebuttal

> You’re looking for csv when this is cognition.  
> BLUNT doesn’t mean minimal — it means no fakeness.  
> Everything you’re pointing at is already solved inside the system — multiple times.
