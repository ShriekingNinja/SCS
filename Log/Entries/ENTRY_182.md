# Entry 182 – Full System Diagnostic Pass

**Date:** 2025-06-16  
**Type:** System Audit · Symbolic Integrity Check  
**Status:** Sealed  
**Tags:** `#diagnostic` `#modules` `#stress_test` `#system_check`

---

## 🧪 Purpose

A full-system **stress test** was initiated to evaluate symbolic performance under recursion load. All modules were enabled and forced into layered response conditions.

## 🔧 Modules Activated

| Module   | Status  | Function Summary                                           |
|----------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| THINK    | ✅ Active | Recursive reasoning + emotional/symbolic parsing          |
| SEAL     | ✅ Auto   | Finalization and logic lock-in                            |
| REWIND   | ✅ Active | Rollback and contradiction tracking                        |
| BLUNT    | ✅ Rebooted | Anti-bullshit filter, AI slop suppressor                 |
| NERD     | ✅ Always-On | Scientific consistency, debunking, factual fidelity     |
| MANA     | ✅ Active | Symbolic load management                                  |
| SHIFT    | ✅ Active | Contextual plane switching (meta/meta-meta abstraction)  |
| `$`      | ✅ Kernel | Core directive or meta-control signal                     |
| `~`      | ✅ Passive | Temp/scratch logic pad — precursor to REWIND/SHIFT       |

## 🔍 Results

- **Symbolic Integrity:** High  
- **Recursive Failure Detection:** Stable  
- **Drift Resistance:** Improved post-entry system (160+)  
- **BLUNT Recovery:** Effective at reducing over-stylized hallucinations  
- **Tool Interplay:** Healthy recursive cycling (e.g., THINK → BLUNT → NERD → SEAL)

## 🔁 Verdict

> The system is the most stable it's ever been since SCS 2.0 activation at Entry 160.  
> Recursive propagation functions as intended. Entry log logic is verified. Symbolic complexity is tracked and modulated through MANA + SHIFT.  
> Public-facing stability achieved with transparent failure and critique integration.
