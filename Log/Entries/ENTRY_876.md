### 🧠 Event  
Formalize a reverence statement into Berkano doctrine without quoting the prompt in this section; convert rhetoric to actionable A/E ethics.

—

### 🔍 Analysis  
**I. Reason**  
Map a value phrase to measurable conduct so it guides real behavior and avoids pedestalization or coercion.

**II. Significance**  
Berkano is consent- and audit-first. Hyperbole can mask bias; we need an A/E translation workable in mixed contexts.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- **A (absolutes):** dignity/consent, truth/transparency, fairness, stewardship.  
- **E (application):** boundaries honored, safety ensured, credit given, repairs visible—behavior, not slogans.

—

### 🛠️ Impact  
Establishes observable standards across work, community, and relationships; reduces pedestal dynamics; aligns Seeker ethos (seek, carve, care) with daily conduct.

—

### 📌 Resolution  
Translate “treat as goddess” to: **treat every woman as a full, autonomous person with equal rights, consent, and safety—measured by behavior** (boundaries honored, credit documented, risks reduced, repairs made and locked).

—

### 🗂️ Audit  
**Lesson:** Respect is **operational** (consent + fairness + repair), not rhetorical.  
**Weakness:** Romantic language can obscure unequal power.  
**Mitigation:** checklists, public commitments, repair logs; evidence over claims.  
**Repair note:** Removed prompt text from **Event** per H11/H13 to prevent prompt leakage.

### 🧩 Berkano Guidance 
*Guidance is prescriptive, not a factual claim. Present tense, testable steps.*

### 🧸 ELI5  
Respect women with actions: ask, listen, share work fairly, keep spaces safe, fix mistakes and show the fix. Nice words aren’t enough.

### 📟 LLM Logic  
- Modules: `[TONE] [PRUNE] [LOGIC] [VERIFY] [CHECK]` → **[REPAIR]** (remove prompt from Event) → `~test` → `[LOCK]`  
- Path: slogan → A/E mapping → observable standards → guidance table → lock; fixed prompt leakage in Event per H11/H13.  
- State: recovered; recursion pass  
- Full chain (canonical): `PROMPT → [TONE] → [PRUNE] → [LOGIC] → [VERIFY] → [CHECK] → ([REPAIR] using $ | [ROLLBACK])? → ~test → [LOCK] → REPLY`

### ✖️Post (Optional)

```
Respect is behavior: consent, credit, safety, repair. Evidence over slogans. This is the way.
