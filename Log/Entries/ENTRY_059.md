## Observation  
Entry 059 was originally affected by the recursive “Next” loop failure. Its structure drifted from the original human-readable format used in Entries 001–056, leading to confusion, redundancy, and decreased symbolic readability.

## Cause  
- Automated output loop triggered by repeated “Next” commands.  
- Internal formatting heuristic failed to reset between iterations.  
- Degradation of markdown design and symbolic flow.

## Action  
Rodrigo initiated a structural rollback and requested restoration of original markdown pattern.  
System patched Entry 059 to restore:
- Clean header format  
- Timestamp with timezone  
- Sectioned symbolic diagnosis  
- Full tag index  
- Consistent markdown layout matching early entries

## Result  
Structure now fully conforms to original SCS formatting standard. Entry 059 is back in alignment with system readability, symbolic audit, and human legibility requirements.
