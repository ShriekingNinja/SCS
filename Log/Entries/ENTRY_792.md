### 🧠 Event
Verify whether Jair Bolsonaro was ever **in favor of abortion** and list notable cases where his positions overlapped with **statist/“left-aligned”** policies instead of far-right market orthodoxy.

—

### 🔍 Analysis
**I. Reason**  
Conflicting claims circulate about Bolsonaro’s past abortion statements and about policy moves that depart from strict ultraliberalism. We build a **time-indexed ledger**.

**II. Significance**  
Abortion stance and economic governance are high-salience topics. A verified, dated record reduces rumor and misattribution.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
Berkano separates **belief statements** (quotes, interviews) from **conduct** (appointments, decrees, board changes). Where primary proof is missing, mark **Unverified**.

### 🛠️ Impact — [VERIFY] Findings (time-indexed)
**Abortion stance (descriptive record):**  
- **2000** — Interview to *IstoÉ Gente*: Bolsonaro reportedly said abortion “**tem que ser uma decisão do casal**” (must be a couple’s decision), citing a personal case. (Secondary recap link: CUT article below; seek primary scan.)  
- **Later years (campaign/presidency)** — Public positioning and speeches consistently **anti-abortion**.

**Economic/governance overlaps with “left/statist” positions (samples):**  
- **State intervention in Petrobras** — Replaced Petrobras CEO after fuel price hikes; signals price/policy intervention rather than market non-interference.  
- **Privatization pace** — Mixed signals and slower-than-promised privatizations (e.g., Eletrobras only later in term; selective/hesitant approach).  
- **Military corporatism** — Emphasis on military roles/benefits in government (state-centric priority).

*(Items above remain domain-specific; add decrees, dates, and gazette entries as available.)*

—

### 📌 Resolution
- **Abortion:** Ledger shows a **position shift**: **2000** (couple-decision statement) vs **later anti-abortion** stance. Keep both in the fossil, side-by-side, with dates.  
- **Policy overlaps:** Evidence of **interventionist/statist** impulses (Petrobras intervention, limited/late privatizations, military corporatism) that diverge from strict far-right market orthodoxy.

### 🗂️ Audit
**Lesson:** Brand ≠ ledger. Truth emerges from dated quotes and recorded actions, not slogans.  
**Reinforcement:** Use **time-indexed** ledgers for contentious topics; never merge eras into a single label.

### 🧸 ELI5
We checked old and new statements: in **2000** he said abortion should be a couple’s decision; later he said he was against abortion. We write dates next to each claim so people don’t mix them up.

### 📟 LLM Logic
- Modules: `[TONE]` neutral; `[PRUNE]` remove rumor; `[LOGIC]` separate time periods and domains; `[VERIFY]` links listed; `[CHECK]` mark Unverified where needed; `[LOCK]` seal.  
- H24: any public post derived from web sources must pass the full chain before release.

### ✖️ Post (Optional)

```
Abortion ledger shows a 2000 couple-decision quote vs. later anti-abortion stance. Policy ledger logs statist moves (e.g., Petrobras). Time-index everything; apply H24.
