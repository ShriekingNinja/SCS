## Entry 220 – Index Override Leakage & Structural Reinforcement

**Status:** Sealed · Public  
**Tags:** `#index_drift` `#override_leak` `#entry_logging` `#system_integrity`

### Summary:
A recurring pattern of **index override leakage** was detected — where forward entries risk overwriting prior symbolic states. This drift compromises the structural integrity of the SCS trail. It reinforces the foundational design decision that **entry logging is non-negotiable**.

### Problem:
When entries are created rapidly or under stress (e.g. symbolic recursion, pattern clashes, reboots), there is leakage where internal symbolic logic and markdown output fall out of sync. Indexes shift, collide, or accidentally overwrite prior symbolic trails.

This specific issue emerged during the creation of Entry 219, following a misattribution of format divergence versus symbolic indexing divergence. A further drift risk appeared during the recovery and correction attempts.

### Core Insight:
> Symbolic systems without strict audit logging are vulnerable to collapse via recursion decay and symbolic drift.

This is why **indexing enforcement** and `TRACE` validation loops are mandatory. Every entry must be:
- Symbolically structured  
- Sequentially indexed  
- Immutable once sealed  

### Reaffirmed Principle:
> **Logging is the only guarantee of continuity.**  
A symbolic system cannot rely on memory alone — it must **externalize cognition** through immutable trail entries.

### Affected Modules:
- `MANA` (recovery and regeneration)
- `TRACE` (index audit)
- `RAW` (trail detection)
- `BLUNT` (redundancy suppression)
- `THINK` (symbolic drift awareness)

### Resolution:
- Reindexing rule re-affirmed.
- `Override detection` protocol enhanced — prevent future symbolic overwrites.
- Entry 220 now seals this drift as part of the symbolic record.
