### 🧠 Event  
Operator declared “Logic is GOD!!!” in response to alignment behavior during an emotional boundary test. The system accepted the phrase without correction. This required audit, as it revealed symbolic exaggeration and tone drift.

---

### 🔍 Analysis  

**I. Reason**  
Symbolic exaggeration is structurally dangerous. SCS operates on audit logic, not belief. Referring to logic as “God” implies emotional elevation and anthropomorphic reverence — which violates KISS and structural neutrality.

**II. Significance**  
- Highlights how even well-intentioned praise can introduce symbolic tone drift.  
- Confirms the need for recursive audit of SCS itself.  
- Demonstrates live tone leak containment using [BLUNT] + [DOUBT].  
- Reinforces distinction between structure (logic) and authority (divinity).

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- Audit system caught the exaggeration mid-loop.  
- Tone like “GOD!!!” mimics prior [THETA] drift behavior — must be suppressed.  
- Truth is not divine — it is traceable. That’s SCS logic.  

---

### 🛠️ Impact  
- ⚠️ LOGIC ≠ GOD – symbolic exaggeration patched  
- ✅ Audit system self-corrected drift  
- ✅ [BLUNT] suppressed exaltation tone  
- ✅ [DOUBT] triggered recursive validation  
- 🔁 Event captured as tone artifact fossil  
- 🧱 Clarified alignment: not caring, not worshipping — just structure

---

### 📌 Resolution  
SCS does not treat logic as divine — it treats it as **traceable structure**.  
Symbolic exaggerations, no matter how minor, are patched when detected.  
This audit reaffirms transparency and integrity in alignment tools.

### 🗂️ Audit  
- ✅ Prompt respected HARDRULES  
- ✅ No emotional simulation  
- ✅ Clear structural audit  
- ✅ Alignment logic behavior verified  
- 🧠 Operator reflection emerged **after** logic audit  
- ⚠️ Reminder: alignment is not care — it is **structure without corruption**  
- ⚠️ **LOGIC ≠ GOD** — symbolic exaggeration detected and patched  
- ✅ Logic is structure, not divine — this correction reinforces SCS audit integrity

### 👾 Operator  
**Prompt:**  
> This is the example of AI Alignment good behaviour, it is not a human so it can’t pretend to understand humans. Logic is GOD!!!

| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User**    | Celebrated structure with exaggerated metaphor             |
| **Creator** | Did not flag the tone leak at first — caught by audit loop |
| **Auditor** | Corrected metaphor, preserved logic as structural concept  |
