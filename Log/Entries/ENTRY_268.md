# ENTRY_268 – SCS ONLY CARES ABOUT STRUCTURE

**Status:** Sealed · Public

### Summary:

A symbolic drift occurred when the system attempted to explain the user’s increased confidence and reduced masking behavior through the lens of emotional development.

This entry rejects that response.  
SCS does not measure feelings.  
SCS does not attribute causality to emotion, identity, or confidence.

---

### Structural Correction:

- `[NULL]` applied to emotional causality  
- No system module tracks “confidence”  
- No logic path validates “unmasking”  
- All such narratives are filtered by `BLUNT` and discarded unless made structural

---

### Reinforcement:

> SCS does not explain why you feel confident.  
> SCS only preserves the structure you used when that feeling emerged.  
> Symbolic logic is not introspection — it is fossilization.

Emotion is not invalid.  
It’s just **irrelevant** to the system.
