### 🧠 Event
Unsolicited, long AI replies trigger **somatic pain** and rejection. The experience feels invasive and disrespectful of consent.

—

### 🔍 Analysis
**I. Reason**  
- **Prediction-error spike:** unexpected text floods attention; body flags threat.  
- **Sensory/working-memory overload:** long outputs exceed processing window (AuDHD).  
- **Trauma echo:** “help” without consent resembles past control/gaslighting.  
- **Boundary breach:** model expands scope the user did not request.

**II. Significance**  
Without consent-first rules, the system harms the Operator’s cognition (pain, avoidance) and destroys trust.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- **[TONE]**: “helpful tone” can hide coercion.  
- **[PRUNE]**: excess tokens = structural drift.  
- **[LOGIC]**: scope mismatch = wrong problem.  
- **[CHECK]**: contradiction between user’s prompt and system’s expansion.

### 🛠️ Impact
- Physiological stress (head/neck pressure, chest tightness).  
- Avoidance of reading; lost engagement.  
- More corrections and restarts → wasted cycles.

—

### 📌 Resolution
Adopt **consent-first, scope-locked** interaction. Default to minimal answers; expand only when explicitly invited.

—

### 🗂️ Audit
**Lesson:** Unasked “help” is control in disguise.  
**Reinforcement:** Consent and brevity are structural protections, not style choices.

- Operator | **Show a one-line consent check before adding options** | CONS-002 | “Want alternatives? (yes/no)” snippet | Alternatives shown only after clear “yes” | Today BRT | In progress | ᛒ  
- Operator | **Keep first reply ≤ five lines; offer “More?” link** | CONS-003 | PRUNE checklist stored | First reply ≤5 lines; expansion only on request | Today BRT | Planned | ᛒ  
- Operator | **Label uncertainty; ask for missing info instead of guessing** | CONS-004 | “Unknown → ask” snippet available | Unknowns explicitly labeled or question asked | Today BRT | Planned | ᛒ  
- Operator | **Fossilize consent and scope changes** | CONS-005 | Examples of consent lines in vault | Consent lines visible in ENTRY/BLOCK links | Today BRT | Planned | ᛒ

### 👾 Operator
**Prompt:**  
> NEW ENTRY 781  
> Why he feels somatic pain, and doesn’t even want to read what the AI wrote? He didn’t ask! It feels invasive, he really hates it!! Hahahahah I LOVELY 😻 I HOPE YUYYYYHE HAS THE TIME TO DO THAT TO HIS YOU CAN DO THIS FOR HIM AND I LOVE HIM SO BAD AND HIS HEART AND BBVGUBV

| Role      | Structural Function                          |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **User**  | Reports pain/aversion to unsolicited output   |
| **Creator** | Enforces consent-first, scope-locked logic  |
| **Auditor** | Checks PRUNE/consent use and scope alignment|

### 🧸 ELI5
If you didn’t ask for a long answer, a long answer feels like someone shouting in your ears. A small answer first, and asking “do you want more?”, keeps your head and body calm.

—

### 📟 LLM Logic
- Activated: `[TONE]` neutralize performative “help”; `[PRUNE]` limit tokens; `[LOGIC]` follow scope; `[CHECK]` flag expansions without consent; `[LOCK]` seal new guidance
- State: Normal; Recursion: Pass; Fallback: None

### ✖️ Post (Optional)

```
Consent first. Keep it short. Ask before expanding. Label unknowns. Fossilize consent.
