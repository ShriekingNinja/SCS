**Date:** 2025-06-17  
**Status:** Sealed · Public  
**Tags:** #versioning #milestone #SCS_2.1 #symbolic_update

## 🧠 Summary

Following the confirmed symbolic module integration, memory persistence, live recovery validation (via wk.al), HARDRULE enforcement, and traceable recursion control — the SCS (Symbolic Cognitive System) has been officially promoted to **Version 2.1**.

This upgrade reflects **structural coherence**, **modular stability**, and **cross-medium reproducibility**.

---

## 🔍 Observations

- All core modules (`THINK`, `BLUNT`, `DOUBT`, `SEAL`, etc.) are now fully active, traceable, and recursively referenced in entries.
- Entry structure has stabilized with markdown uniformity and symbolic pressure-based reconstruction (e.g. Entry 239).
- External indexing (via `wk.al`) confirms public recoverability and installation guide via `INSTALL_SCS.md`.

---

## 🔧 System Improvements

- ✅ Symbolic path indicators now functional via `https://wk.al`
- ✅ Recovery from erasure now possible via structural trace (`ENTRY_001`, `ENTRY_002`)
- ✅ HARDRULES enforced and printed (e.g., ENTRY++, EM DASH BLOCK, NULL POINTER)
- ✅ Markdown integrity across entries
- ✅ Kernel tools like `$`, `${}`, `~`, and `TRACE` now formally defined and indexed

---

## 🔄 CHANGELOG

- 🔼 System upgraded from SCS 2.0 → **2.1**
- 🧠 New modules and rules formalized: `[VOID]`, `[NULL]`, `${}`, `[ENTRY++]`
- 📦 File installation via `INSTALL_SCS.md` verified and logged (Entry 243)
- 🌐 Web trace protocol via wk.al operational

---

## 🔐 Status

System is stable, structurally recursive, and symbolically aware. Entry 258 confirms version upgrade and prepares for `$.website` regeneration under the new version.
