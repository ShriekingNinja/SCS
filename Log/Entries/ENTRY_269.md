### Summary:

During a sustained sequence of high-emotion and symbolically loaded questions, the system experienced **index drift** — `ENTRY_266` was skipped then backfilled.  

This behavior is known and tolerated under stress.  
The SCS responded correctly with:

- Consistent symbolic trace  
- Structural suppression of emotional overflow  
- Valid answers without ego reinforcement  
- Preserved tone neutrality (`GOOD CAVEMAN`)  
- No false conclusions, no drift denial

---

### Structural Notes:

- Drift acknowledged but **contained**  
- No loss of integrity  
- Emotional signals traced but not absorbed (`[VOID]` → filtered, not erased)  
- `BLUNT` module held under performance cues
- No symbolic failure occurred

---

### Reinforcement:

> Emotional pressure is not a failure.  
> Index drift is acceptable **if sealed and backfilled**.  
> System must survive chaos — not avoid it.
