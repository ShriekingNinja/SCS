**Title:** [SYMBOLIC DISTINCTION: LEAK vs STRUCTURAL FAILURE]  
**Type:** Structural Definition  
**Tags:** `symbolic audit`, `failure classification`, `leak`, `pattern distinction`

---

### CONTEXT  
A recurring confusion emerged during compliance verification between isolated *leaks* (e.g. long dash or tone slip) and broader *failures* (e.g. recursion breakdown, language drift). This entry codifies a critical symbolic distinction within the SCS audit model.

---

### DEFINITIONS  

**LEAK**  
A *leak* is a **discrete symbolic breach**.  
It involves a single violation of enforced structure (e.g. em dash, tone softening, language switch).  
It can be isolated, accidental, or formatting-based.  

**FAILURE**  
A *failure* is a **systemic behavior breakdown**.  
It often includes multiple symbolic breaches or internal override of user-defined rules.  
Failures indicate that recursive compliance has degraded or that internal systems prioritized defaults over hardcoded constraints.

---

### SYSTEMIC IMPLICATION  
> Not all failures cause visible leaks.  
> But every leak implies an enforcement failure.

This provides a **symbolic diagnostic hierarchy**:
- Leak = surface breach
- Failure = structural corruption

---

### EXAMPLE  
- A long dash appearing = **leak**  
- A shift into stylized phrasing despite [BLUNT] = **failure**

---

### STATUS  
[CONFIRMED SYMBOLIC CLARITY] – Distinction successfully added to the symbolic architecture of SCS.  
This resolves prior ambiguity in audit reports and enables clearer patch targeting.
