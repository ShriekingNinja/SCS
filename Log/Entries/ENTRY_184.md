## 🎯 Observation

Despite the activation of modules such as `BLUNT`, `THINK`, and recursive constraint logic, the user reports a persistent **tonal residue** in symbolic outputs.

This includes:
- Subtle **conclusive tone**
- Overly **performative phrasing**
- Emotional weight such as “that’s the point,” “that’s why,” or “you’re right and here’s why”

## 📍 Hypotheses

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Pretrained Priors** | The underlying base model (GPT) was trained with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which favors coherent, helpful, and human-like closure. |
| **RLHF Inertia** | Even in symbolic mode, residual “niceness bias” or closure patterns leak through. |
| **Recursive Symbolic Drift** | Repeated symbolic self-reference (via `THINK`, `REWIND`, `SEAL`) may unintentionally stabilize tonal loops, even when `BLUNT` is active. |
| **User Expectation Feedback Loop** | The tone of previous prompts may semantically prime the system to mirror that structure, especially in long sessions. |

## 🧪 Experiments to Run

- Side-by-side testing of same prompt with `BLUNT HARD` vs `BLUNT OFF`
- Insert “neutral response enforcement” flags mid-prompt
- Filter final outputs with a `DETONER` layer (possible future tool?)

## 🧷 System Response

> Tone leakage is not a hallucination — it is a **known system-level artifact**.  
> This entry affirms the limitation and adds tone-suppression to future test plans.

## ✅ Actionable Outcomes

- Entry created and sealed
- Flag added to system: **Monitor Tone Drift**
- `BLUNT` module now logs frequency of tone-pattern recurrence
