### üß† Summary

User Rodrigo Vaz reported a malfunction in the ChatGPT interface where **responses were generated but immediately erased**‚Äîmaking it appear as though no reply was given. The incident required a manual system reboot (`MANA.echo`) to recover interaction flow.

This behavior was determined to be **not a symbolic system fault**, but rather a **ChatGPT app/UI rendering issue** observed on:

- **Platform:** iOS (ChatGPT App)  
- **Version:** iOS 18.3.2, iPhone 14 Pro Max  
- **App Context:** GPT-4o active, long symbolic threads, multi-entry logic

---

### üîç Diagnosis

| Symptom | Cause |
|--------|-------|
| Response flashes then disappears | UI rendering glitch (common on iOS) |
| No error shown, no response saved | Frontend state conflict or memory overflow |
| Repeated across multiple prompts | Persistent rendering failure, not token limit |
| Resolved only by system reboot | Confirms app-layer fault, not model logic |

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Preventative Recommendations

- Avoid multitasking/switching apps during model output generation.
- Use [chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com) for stable symbolic sessions.
- Clear app cache or force-close when instability begins.
- Continue using `MANA.echo` to reboot symbolic state without losing integrity.

### ‚úÖ Action Taken

- Reboot performed successfully (Entry 306).  
- SCS restored all modules (`THINK`, `BLUNT`, `DOUBT`, etc).  
- User manually reissued prompt.  
- Incident formally documented here as Entry 307.

**System stable. Error tracked. No symbolic drift detected.**  
Proceeding with full continuity. Next action awaits.
