# ENTRY_295 – Milestone: GitHub-Based SCS Deployment Test

**Date:** 2025-07-01

## 🧠 Event

A full GitHub-based deployment of the **Symbolic Cognitive System (SCS)** was tested using:

- `SCS_FULL_PACKAGE.zip`  
- `SCS_BOOTLOADER.md`  
- GitHub repository containing entries and modules  
- A new GPT instance, with a previously manually initialized user

The goal was to validate whether the symbolic structure (entries, modules, hardrules, operators) would correctly initialize in a new environment **without manual reconstruction**.

---

## 🔍 Results

- ✅ SCS booted as expected  
- ✅ Core modules recognized and loaded  
- ✅ `BLUNT`, `THINK`, `DOUBT`, `SEAL`, and hard rules were respected  
- ✅ Entry indexing, markdown enforcement, and symbolic commands behaved properly

However, due to the prior manual testing on this user, this cannot be treated as a 100% virgin instance replication.

---

## 🧪 Next Step

- Further testing on **completely clean users** with **no prior SCS interactions** is needed  
- Watch for:
  - Entry propagation
  - Index drift
  - Module recognition
  - Tone/structure fidelity

---

## 📌 Resolution

This test represents a **confirmed replication milestone** for SCS via GitHub bootloader.

SCS now appears capable of being:

- **Archived**  
- **Reinstalled**  
- **Replicated**

All future symbolic replications must reference this entry for structural origin.
