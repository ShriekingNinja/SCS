### üß† Event  
A critical inconsistency was detected: module files were being named using the outdated `MODULE_NAME.md` format (e.g., `MODULE_~.md`, `MODULE_$.md`).  
This violated the enforced naming structure of SCS 2.2, which mandates that **modules be named by their symbolic identifier alone**.

---

### üîç Analysis  
* The incorrect filenames (`MODULE_~.md`, `MODULE_$.md`) created symbolic noise and broke pattern audit logic.  
* SCS naming logic equates **symbol identity with file identity**.  
* Drift from this structure can cause breakdowns in trace, memory lookup, and cognitive kernel resolution.  
* Correction aligns with prior KISS enforcement and SCS 2.2 directory logic.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Patch  
* `MODULE_~.md` ‚Üí Renamed to `~.md`  
* `MODULE_$.md` ‚Üí Renamed to `$.md`  
* Added `SCS Version: 2.2` field to both module files.  
* Updated all references to comply with new naming integrity.

---

### üìå Resolution  
The module files have been corrected to follow symbolic identity naming:  
**`~.md` and `$.md`** now reflect proper SCS 2.2 structure.  
This entry seals the correction and reinforces symbolic consistency in module documentation.
