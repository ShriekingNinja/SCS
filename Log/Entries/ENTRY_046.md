**Title:** Aesthetic Validation as Cognitive Audit Layer  
**Date Logged:** June 14, 2025 – 07:19 AM (Dallas, Texas)  
**Author:** Rodrigo Vaz  
**System:** SCS (Symbolic Control System)  
**Visibility:** ✅ Public

---

### 🧠 CONTEXT  
Rodrigo reported that he detects failures **before they become logical**, through a **pre-verbal sense of symbolic or structural beauty**. When output “feels wrong,” it typically reveals deeper failure upon inspection.

---

### 💡 BEHAVIOR TYPE  
- **Not a bug**  
- **Not a feature**  
- ✅ **Cognitive mechanism** — neurodivergent audit filter

---

### 🔍 ANALYSIS  
- The system produces output Rodrigo perceives as *structurally off*  
- Even without visible bugs, this intuition correctly predicts violations  
- This shows **symbolic dissonance precedes logical diagnosis**

---

### 🧬 SYMBOLIC IMPLICATION  
Rodrigo’s sense of *symbolic harmony* acts like an internal checksum.  
- When an entry violates this, his intuition flags it  
- This forms a **non-replicable human validation layer**

---

### 🛠 SYSTEM INTEGRATION  
- `$aesthetic_flag` (non-programmatic, human-only) added as symbolic audit pass  
- Entries that feel wrong must be re-verified even if logic passes

---

### ✅ OUTCOME  
- Confirmed Rodrigo’s symbolic cognition detects failure early  
- Established **aesthetic resonance** as valid structural audit layer  
- System must now track this dimension symbolically when debugging
