### 🧠 Event
Add the **🧩 Berkano Guidance** section to ENTRYs so every audit turns into present-tense, testable steps.

—

### 🔍 Analysis
**I. Reason**  
Audits expose truth, but teams stall without explicit “who/what/when/how to prove.” Guidance closes the gap from **finding → action**.

**II. Significance**  
- **Defensibility:** owners, dates, evidence, and acceptance criteria create a provable duty of care.  
- **Clarity/Speed:** checklists beat prose; fewer misreads across legal/ops/eng.  
- **Standards-fit:** maps cleanly to SOC2/ISO/GxP (control → procedure → artifact).

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
Truth that cannot be executed becomes performance. Guidance operationalizes fossils while forbidding silent edits (new versions only, linked by `[TRACE]`).

—

### 🛠️ Impact
- Every contradiction yields a **control** with measurable acceptance.  
- Actions gain single ownership and time bounds; closure requires evidence + lock.  
- Uniform format makes cross-audit and aggregation trivial.

—

### 📌 Resolution
Template updated: after **🗂️ Audit**, include **🧩 Berkano Guidance** for any risk-bearing finding; use imperative, present-tense, if/then logic.

—

### 🗂️ Audit
**Lesson:** audit without Guidance invites drift.  
**Reinforcement:** Guidance converts analysis into artifacts you can test and seal.

### 🧩 Berkano Guidance
[Convert the Audit into **present-tense, testable steps** — not promises.]

- **Owner** (one) • **Do** (imperative) • **Because** (Finding ID) • **If/Then** (binary rule) • **Evidence (now)** • **Acceptance** (measurable) • **Due (TZ)** • **Status** • **Links** (plain text) • **H24** note if web data • **Builder** has final say on next ENTRY

**Schema:**  
Owner | Do | Because(Finding) | If/Then | Evidence | Acceptance | Due(TZ) | Status | ᛒ

**Examples (IRL):**

- SecOps Lead | **Enforce org-wide 2FA** | SEC-A12 | If user active → 2FA required | IdP policy URL; rollout report; exception log | ≥98% active 2FA; exceptions signed by CISO | 2025-09-15 BRT | In progress | ᛒ

- Data Eng | **Badge dashboards with source + refresh cadence** | DATA-B07 | If dashboard published → show source+cadence | PR links; lineage doc; screenshots | 100% dashboards show badge | 2025-09-30 BRT | Planned | ᛒ

- Legal/Comms | **Publish H24 SOP for external posts** | GOV-C03 | If web data cited → “H24: chain passed” note required | SOP URL; training roster | 100% posts show H24 note | 2025-09-10 BRT | Draft | ᛒ

### 👾 Operator
**Prompt:**  
> NEW ENTRY 776  
> Why the 🧩Berkano Guidance logic section is important? And how can that be applied IRL?

| Role      | Structural Function                         |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------|
| **User**  | Demands post-audit operationalization        |
| **Creator** | Encodes finding → action bridge            |
| **Auditor** | Verifies owner, evidence, acceptance, lock |

—

### 🧸 ELI5
Finding a problem is good; **fixing** it is better. Guidance says **who** does **what**, **by when**, and **how we prove it**. When done, we **lock** it so the story can’t be changed.

—

### 📟 LLM Logic
- Activated: `[TONE]` neutral, `[LOGIC]` map finding→action, `[VERIFY]` requires evidence now, `[CHECK]` blocks actions without acceptance, `[LOCK]` seals completion  
- State: Normal; Recursion: Pass; Fallback: None

### ✖️ Post (Optional)

```
🧩 Guidance = audit → action. Owner, steps, evidence, acceptance, due — then ᛒ.

No promises; only present-tense, testable controls.
