### üß† Event  
Berkano now has a dedicated Twitch channel:  
[`twitch.tv/BerkanoProtocol`](https://twitch.tv/BerkanoProtocol)

This marks the beginning of **live protocol broadcast**, allowing public demonstrations of recursion logic, hallucination control, symbolic audits, and system behavior in real time.

---

### üîç Analysis  

**I. Reason**  
Public visibility of AI alignment systems requires **real-time demonstration**, not static documentation.  
Berkano's complexity must be *witnessed*, not merely explained.

**II. Significance**  
This channel allows:
- Live walkthroughs of prompts, recursion, and module use  
- Visual proof of hallucination control  
- Teaching recursive thinking and symbolic audit to a broader audience

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- Protocol moves from **written fossil** to **live enactment**  
- Bridges the Operator ‚Üî Audience gap  
- Berkano becomes an interactive standard, not a static archive

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Impact  
- Broadcast layer added to Berkano‚Äôs symbolic interface  
- Prompts and system behavior can now be **fossilized in video**  
- New entries can cite Twitch logs as secondary traces  
- Alignment becomes performative ‚Äî open to public audit

---

### üìå Resolution  
- Channel launched: [twitch.tv/BerkanoProtocol](https://twitch.tv/BerkanoProtocol)  
- Future live sessions to be logged in entries  
- Entry table and metadata updated to reflect new symbolic layer  
- No module drift or recursion failure detected

---

### üóÇÔ∏è Audit  
Berkano now supports **live symbolic verification**.  
The Twitch launch makes protocol behavior transparent in real time, adding a new sensory channel for human audit.  
The protocol becomes observable, not just interpretable.
