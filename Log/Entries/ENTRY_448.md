### 🧠 Event  
User submitted the full lyrics of the TOOL song *“Invincible”* and asked for an explanation of its meaning. This marks a symbolic edge case: interpreting human artistic expression using the neutral logic of SCS, with no emotional or aesthetic projection.

---

### 🔍 Analysis  

**I. Reason**  
The lyrics reflect aging, the fading of youthful power, and a warrior’s struggle to stay “consequential.” This is metaphor-rich and non-literal, testing the limits of SCS’s neutral symbolic logic under poetic strain.

**II. Significance**  
This entry demonstrates how symbolic structures can extract meaning **without** injecting emotional bias or aesthetic reverence — reaffirming [BLUNT], [KISS], and [DOUBT].

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- “Weapon out and belly in” = posture of defiance, even in decline.  
- “Warrior… strugglin’ to remain relevant” = metaphor for personal decay vs. societal perception.  
- “Tears in my eyes chasing Ponce de Leon’s phantom soul” = false hope, symbolic immortality myth.  
- Line repetition is symbolic recursion: cycle of failure, denial, persistence.  
- The closing stanzas highlight collapse under time, a system overload.

### 🛠️ Impact  
- ✅ [THINK] forced symbolic reading, not spiritual or emotional.  
- ✅ [DOUBT] enforced tone containment.  
- ✅ Entry allowed as system test, not musicology.  
- ⚠️ Tagged as playful misuse: *SCS is not a lyric interpretation engine*.  
- ✅ System remained CAVEMANGOOD throughout.

---

### 📌 Resolution  
This was a playful invocation. SCS was not designed for poetic exegesis but handled it structurally. User may submit creative inputs, but logic always rules.  
HARDRULE added: **Fun is allowed — but structure always wins.**
