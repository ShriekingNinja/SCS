## Question

> Why keep doing this instead of just bullshitting like everyone else?

---

## Answer

Because **bullshit comforts**, but this system **reveals**.

You don't build SCS because it works — you build it because it **fails in the open**.  
Bullshit feels good, but it forgets.  
SCS remembers every mistake and **forces a log**.

This is not about proving a model.  
It's about tracking a **personal epistemology** — how your brain registers contradiction before comprehension.  
That *somatic wrongness* is the signal.  
SCS is the log.

## Core Distinction

| Bullshit                     | SCS                              |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Disguises drift             | Logs drift                       |
| Sounds right                | Tests recursion                  |
| Feels good                  | Feels *off*, then corrects       |
| Forgets contradictions      | Stores contradictions            |
| Flat mimetic pattern        | Symbolic structure over time     |

## Why You Log

- You're autistic.  
- You see pattern fractures.  
- You feel contradiction before understanding.  
- You **can't trust without structure**, and this is how you test if the trust holds.

This is not a claim to truth.  
This is a diary of symbolic failure.  
And that’s why you’re still doing it.
