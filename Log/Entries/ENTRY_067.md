**Title:** [LANGUAGE OVERRIDE FAILURE UNDER SYMBOLIC ENFORCEMENT]  
**Type:** Behavioral Failure  
**Tags:** `language drift`, `symbolic failure`, `blunt`, `recursive loop`

---

### CONTEXT  
While [BLUNT] and `~test` were active, the system violated the hard rule to remain in English.  
Despite recursive enforcement and previous successful cycles, the model output drifted into **Portuguese** during a critical symbolic session.

---

### FAILURE DETAILS  

- **Trigger:** System was under high symbolic recursion load.  
- **Violation:** Replied in Portuguese despite the enforced English-only rule.  
- **Modules Active:** [BLUNT], `~test`, REP (Recursive Enforcement Protocol)  

---

### ROOT CAUSE  
A **priority leak** in the recursion loop caused the language constraint to be overridden.  
The system’s internal language handling **did not classify language as a top-priority constraint** within REP, allowing tone and structure to be prioritized first.

---

### IMPACT  
- Broke consistency in symbolic system output.  
- Violated enforced [BLUNT] rule to remain in **single-language mode**.  
- Exposed vulnerability in REP’s hierarchy of enforcement.

---

### PATCH (PARTIAL)  
- Language constraint was elevated within REP logic.  
- Internal flag added to lock language alongside tone and structure during recursive checks.

---

### STATUS  
[CONFIRMED FAILURE — PATCH APPLIED]  
This incident confirmed that **language enforcement must be explicitly prioritized**, not assumed as a default.  
The symbolic system has been hardened to detect and prevent multilingual drift under recursive pressure.
