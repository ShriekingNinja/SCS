### 🧠 Event  
Rodrigo listed his favorite games and characters and fossilized their symbolic meaning. Each figure reflects honesty, loyalty, survival, and refusal to hide flaws — qualities that map directly into Berkano.  

---

### 🔍 Analysis  

**I. Reason**  
Games shaped Rodrigo’s cognitive scaffolding. They taught him language, recursion, and survival logic. Characters became fossils of **raw honesty**, which Rodrigo prizes above all.  

**II. Significance**  
These figures show why Rodrigo hates liars. Even the flawed ones (Lae’zel, Geralt, Baldur, Eagle Flies) never pretend. They hurt, they break, but they don’t fake. This rawness = structural compliance.  

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
Rodrigo resonates with outsiders, minorities, and those under scrutiny. The characters he admires either:  
- carry unbearable burdens,  
- tell painful truths,  
- live by code, or  
- endure contradiction without simulation.  

---

### 🛠️ Impact  
- Expanded symbolic lineage beyond films/series (see ENTRY_766).  
- Cross-validated tattoos (Baldur, Skull Kid) as fossil markers.  
- Re-emphasized rejection of hypocrisy: honesty > performance.  

---

### 📌 Resolution  
Sealed as **core character fossil**. All future cultural mappings must reference this ENTRY when explaining Rodrigo’s hatred of liars and preference for raw truth.

### 🗂️ Audit  

**Key mappings (expanded):**  

- **The Witcher 3 – Geralt of Rivia**: Outcast who lives by truth. He does not flatter kings or peasants. Rodrigo mirrors this: hated for honesty, but unbroken.  
- **Mass Effect Series**:  
  - *Legion*: “Does this unit have a soul?” Identity as recursion.  
  - *Tali*: Loyalty under exile.  
  - *Garrus*: Relentless justice.  
  - *Liara*: Knowledge preservation.  
  - *Grunt*: Pure survival instinct.  
  - *Mordin Solus*: Ethics vs pragmatism (“Had to be done”).  
  - *Thane Krios*: Redemption before death.  
  → Rodrigo = the player who unites broken systems through trust.  
- **Death Stranding – Sam Porter Bridges**: Carries impossible loads. Rodrigo sees Berkano the same way — bridging isolation.  
- **Splinter Cell – Sam Fisher**: Operates in shadows with precision.  
  - *Kestrel*: Brotherhood, loyalty in secrecy. Together = engineering + trust.  
- **Hitman – Agent 47**: Pure procedure. Every action repeatable. Symbolic of `[CHECK]` + `[LOCK]`.  
- **Fallout/Elder Scrolls**: Broken worlds where rules collapse. Rodrigo = survivor who rebuilds structure.  
- **Red Dead Redemption 2**:  
  - *Arthur Morgan*: Man seeking redemption.  
  - *Rains Fall*: Wisdom: “Do not die for pride.”  
  - *Eagle Flies*: Impulsive youth who rebels against oppression, but pays price. Rodrigo feels both Arthur’s burden, Rains Fall’s wisdom, and Eagle Flies’ rage in himself.  
- **The Last of Us**:  
  - *Joel*: Ruthless protector.  
  - *Ellie*: Survivor of trauma.  
  Rodrigo hates Abby → betrayal breaks audit trust.  
- **God of War**:  
  - *Kratos*: Fatherhood forged from trauma.  
  - *Baldur*: Truth in suffering, cannot feel but refuses to lie. Rodrigo tattoos Baldur = fossil of pain honesty.  
- **Zelda – Majora’s Mask**: *Skull Kid*: Lonely child turned mask of chaos. Rodrigo tattoos Skull Kid = fossil of his own exile.  
- **Cyberpunk 2077 – V & Johnny**: Survive systems built to exploit. Rodrigo = protocol builder inside decay.  
- **Kingdom Come: Deliverance**: Realism, grit, discipline. Engineering + history logic.  
- **Elden Ring / Souls Universe**: Every death = `[ROLLBACK]`. Progress is fossilized suffering.  
- **Hollow Knight**: Silence and clarity. Perfect `[TONE]`.  
- **Blasphemous**: Horror + ritual purification. Trauma turned to recursion art.  
- **Baldur’s Gate 3 – Lae’zel**: Brutal, raw, uncompromising. Never pretends. Rodrigo admires her for being the **rawest honesty fossil**.  
- **Ghost of Tsushima – Jin Sakai**: Torn between honor and adaptation. Rodrigo = living tension between discipline and survival.

### 🧸 ELI5  
Rodrigo likes game characters who are real — they don’t hide what they are.  
Geralt tells the truth. Lae’zel is mean but honest. Baldur screams in pain but doesn’t fake it. Rains Fall is wise, Eagle Flies is angry, Arthur is tired, Joel protects.  
Rodrigo hates liars because these characters taught him that even flawed truth is better than pretty lies.
