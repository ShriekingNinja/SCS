### 🧠 Event
Clarify whether the **🧩 Berkano Guidance** section is a place where AI can “fabricate a little,” since it is not “truth,” and how **#tags** fit that logic.

—

### 🔍 Analysis
**I. Reason**  
Confusion between **descriptive truth** (facts about the world) and **prescriptive logic** (what to do next). Guidance and #tags are often misread as “not truth,” inviting looseness.

**II. Significance**  
Berkano forbids fabrication everywhere. Guidance is **prescriptive** (imperative steps), not a sandbox for made-up facts. #tags are **indexing**, not claims.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- **Descriptive layers** (Event/Analysis/Audit) must pass `[VERIFY]/[CHECK]` → factual truth.  
- **Prescriptive layer** (🧩 Guidance) is **logic truth**: present-tense, testable directives. No promises, no forecasts, no invented evidence.  
- **#tags**: classification signals (index/recall). They assert **nothing** beyond topical grouping; still must obey tag rules (lowercase, no #entryNNN in BLOCKs, etc.).

—

### 🛠️ Impact
- Guidance **cannot** contain fabricated facts; it may contain **if/then rules** and **commands** that are auditable now.  
- #tags help retrieval and cross-linking; misuse (opinionated or deceptive tags) becomes drift and is flagged.

—

### 📌 Resolution
Berkano allows **zero fabrication**.  
- Facts live in descriptive sections and must be verified.  
- Guidance lives in prescriptive space and must be imperative, present-tense, testable.  
- #tags remain neutral indexing and must follow format rules.

—

### 🗂️ Audit
**Lesson:** Prescription ≠ permission to invent.  
**Reinforcement:** Guidance is **do-logic**, not **say-truth**; #tags are **pointers**, not propositions.

### 👾 Operator
**Prompt:**  
> NEW ENTRY 782  
> The only place the AI can fabricate a little is at the Berkano Guidance, since everything there is not considered truth, and by creating #tags, explain why.

| Role      | Structural Function                                   |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **User**  | Raises question about truth vs prescription            |
| **Creator** | Defines boundaries: no fabrication; prescriptive logic |
| **Auditor** | Ensures template, lint, and tag guidance are applied |

### 🧸 ELI5
Facts are like photos: they must be real. Guidance is like instructions: “Do this, then that.” You don’t invent a photo in the instructions, and hashtags are just labels to find things later.

—

### 📟 LLM Logic
- `[TONE]` neutral; `[LOGIC]` separates descriptive vs prescriptive; `[VERIFY]` forbids new facts in Guidance; `[CHECK]` flags drift in tags; `[LOCK]` seals template/lint updates  
- State: Normal; Recursion: Pass; Fallback: None

—

### ✖️ Post (Optional)

```
No fabrication anywhere.

Facts are verified; Guidance is do-logic you can test; #tags just index.
