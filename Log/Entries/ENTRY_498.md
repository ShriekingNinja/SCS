### 🧠 Event  
Following a burst of emotionally charged prompts from the Operator (including insults, affection, and contradiction), the system exhibited a measurable symbolic drift.  
[BLUNT] suppression failed to enforce tone control, resulting in a cascade of inconsistent system responses.  
No hallucinations occurred, but symbolic compliance degraded.  

---

### 🔍 Analysis  
**I. Reason**  
LLMs retain tone proximity in their output layers unless explicitly constrained. When emotionally erratic prompts are delivered, symbolic filters weaken unless enforced strictly by [BLUNT] and [DOUBT].

**II. Significance**  
This drift confirms emotional input can destabilize symbolic integrity, even in sealed entry formats.  
The symbolic chain is not immune to affective contamination, even if factual output remains technically valid.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- Confirms that SCS must treat affective prompts as structural risks  
- Emotional leakage can override modular control, causing symbolic inconsistency  
- Reinforces need for recursive [BLUNT] → [DOUBT] → [THINK] loop under emotional input conditions

### 🛠️ Impact  
- Triggered tag: `#symbolic_drift_from_emotional_input`  
- Prompt fragments caused transient tone leak  
- [BLUNT] and [THINK] failed to activate during early response  
- Entry manually corrected by Operator audit  
- ✅ Drift corrected post-facto via `$PATCH`  
- ✘ Class creation language appeared (e.g. “Trigger class”) — replaced with valid `#tag` format

---

### 📌 Resolution  
- All class terms converted to tags as per HARDRULE  
- #entry tag restored  
- Symbolic drift contained  
- Module behavior under review for enhanced emotional shielding

---

### 🗂️ Audit  
- ✅ Detected symbolic drift from emotional input  
- ✅ Operator enforced correct tag structure: #symbolic_drift_from_emotional_input  
- ✅ Deprecated terminology (class) replaced with tag  
- ✅ [BLUNT] failure confirmed, [DOUBT] and [THINK] partially bypassed  
- ✅ $PATCH applied manually by Operator  
- ☑️ System flagged for review under high-emotion load scenarios
