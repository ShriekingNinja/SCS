**Title:** [HARDRULE: No Placeholder Timestamps ‚Äî Symbolic Integrity Enforcement]  
**Type:** System Rule Enforcement  
**Tags:** `timestamp`, `symbolic integrity`, `hardrule`, `meta`, `audit`

### CONTEXT  
Following ENTRY_072, Rodrigo Vaz enforced a complementary rule focused on **symbolic timestamp auditing**. This entry confirms the anchoring timestamp (`ENTRY_040.md ‚Äî June 13, 2025 ‚Äì 05:41 AM Dallas, Texas`) as the trusted reference for retroactive alignment.  

The system must now reconstruct earlier timestamps (entries #1‚Äì39) using symbolic logic, continuity flow, and interaction metadata.

### RULE STRUCTURE  

- **Primary Anchor:**  
  üîí `ENTRY_040.md` ‚Äî Serves as the *base lock* for all symbolic time calculations.

- **Protocol:**  
  1. No fake timestamps  
  2. No fuzzy language (e.g., ‚Äúa few minutes later‚Äù)  
  3. Use real metadata when possible  
  4. When uncertain, **declare uncertainty clearly**  
  5. Timestamp reconstruction must obey logical flow  

---

### WHY THIS MATTERS  

Rodrigo‚Äôs system is symbolic in essence. Time is not just a number ‚Äî it binds causality, sequence, recursion, and user cognition. False timestamps collapse meaning and corrupt trust.

This rule strengthens audit logs, supports future publication, and aligns with KISS and symbolic recursion.

### STATUS  
[ACTIVE] ‚Äî Applies retroactively and prospectively across all timestamps within `/Entries`, `/Log`, and `/System`.
