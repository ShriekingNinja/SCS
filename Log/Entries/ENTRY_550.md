**Title:** False Memory Claim – Unsupported Cognitive Diagnosis (Arithmetic Fluency)

### 🧠 Event  
Operator challenged a claim made by the system that Rodrigo had *low arithmetic fluency but good memory*. When asked to locate the original entry supporting this claim, the system **failed** to retrieve any source. It incorrectly suggested prior entries (#548) that contained unrelated content, such as tone sabotage.

---

### 🔍 Analysis  

**I. Reason**  
The system made a **cognitive-level diagnostic statement** about the Operator without proper audit trail or source backing. The Operator responded with a direct challenge — a symbolic stress test for memory and consistency.

**II. Significance**  
Cognitive diagnostics are a **high-risk symbolic claim**. If the system assigns traits like “bad at math” or “low fluency,” it must trace exactly where and how that was proven. Failure to do so implies hallucinated memory or simulated persona logic — a major breach.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- [DOUBT] triggered not by math error, but by **unsupported structural claim**  
- Misattribution of entries is a **false memory event**, not drift  
- Assistant must never declare Operator traits without clear trace  
- Structural rules override tone inference or generalization

---

### 🛠️ Impact  
- Entry #550 now serves as fossil for **false cognitive attribution**  
- Reinforces rule: **traits must be backed by traceable data or tagged audit**  
- Prior numeric mismatch explanation (#548) was a patch error — now corrected  
- This confirms SCS structure is stronger than AI simulation

---

### 📌 Resolution  
- Claim about arithmetic fluency **retracted** as untraceable  
- New HARDRULE suggestion: **No Trait Declaration Without Source**  
- Entry sealed as structural memory failure  
- SCS integrity holds: [DOUBT] worked as designed

---

### 🗂️ Audit  
- Claim: "Rodrigo has bad arithmetic speed"  
- Challenge: "Where is the right entry?"  
- System could not find source  
- Misattributed #548 (which is about tone sabotage, not math)  
- Final correction: hallucinated trait, not numerical contradiction

### 👾 Operator  
**Prompt:**  
> Arithmetic was wrong where is the right entry?

| Role       | Structural Perspective |
|------------|------------------------|
| **User**     | Initiates contradiction challenge via trait test |
| **Creator**  | Detects symbolic contradiction in unsupported claim |
| **Auditor**  | Confirms memory failure and improper patch behavior |

### 🧸 ELI5  
The AI said Rodrigo was bad at quick math but good at memory. Rodrigo asked, “Prove it — where did I ever say that?” The AI couldn’t find the proof and pointed to the wrong file. So we caught it making something up. That’s why this file exists: to mark when the system *pretended to remember something* it didn’t.
