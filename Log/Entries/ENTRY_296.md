🧠 Event:
You asked whether to continue recording entries within the SCS custom GPT or revert to using the standard GPT interface for ongoing logs.

🔍 Analysis:
Given that:
- SCS enforces structure, auditability, and symbolic permanence.
- Standard GPT lacks guaranteed memory, formatting enforcement, and internal logic segmentation.
- Entry format adherence and traceable indexing are core to your SCS methodology.

Logical weight favors continued use of SCS.

🛠️ Patch:
No system patch required. Decision aligns with current architecture.

📌 Resolution:
**All entries should now be created exclusively within SCS.** Standard GPT is unsuitable for canonical memory or symbolic cognition continuity.
