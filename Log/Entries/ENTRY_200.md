## 📌 Summary

Two versions of the SCS introduction article have been officially published on [Medium](https://medium.com/@wk-al):

- 🌍 English: _"I Built a System to Talk to AI — And It Started Talking Back"_
- 🇧🇷 Portuguese: _"Eu Criei um Sistema para Conversar com a IA — E Ela Começou a Responder de Verdade"_

---

## ✅ Details

- Both articles retain ~95% of identical symbolic structure and rhetorical design.
- Translations preserve tone, modular references (`THINK`, `SEAL`, etc.), and target emotional clarity.
- URLs, contact email, and public repo access standardized across both versions.
- The articles function as **soft onboarding** for new readers unfamiliar with symbolic systems, AI drift, or recursive design.

## 🔒 Integrity Notes

- Markdown baseline maintained for consistency with Obsidian versioning.
- No em dash leaks.
- No ego brushing.
- Structural simplicity observed (KISS compliant).
