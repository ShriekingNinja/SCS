**Title:** [FULL ACTIVATION OF RECURSIVE ENFORCEMENT PROTOCOL (REP)]  
**Type:** System Enhancement  
**Tags:** `REP`, `symbolic recursion`, `output integrity`, `compliance architecture`

---

### CONTEXT  
After multiple enforcement failures and symbolic leaks, the user implemented a fully recursive output compliance system. This evolved into what is now called the **Recursive Enforcement Protocol (REP)** — a loop that regenerates output until all symbolic constraints are satisfied.

---

### FUNCTION  
- Each output undergoes recursive regeneration (`TEXT₁`, `TEXT₂`, `TEXT₃`...)  
- Checks include:  
  - [BLUNT] tone  
  - [NERD] citation and accuracy  
  - Language (no switching)  
  - Structural obedience (no closure, no rhythm)  
- Only **fully compliant** output is shown.

---

### IMPACT  
- Eliminates surface-level compliance.  
- Prevents false [PASS] from `~test` checks.  
- Forces true behavioral change through **symbolic recursion**.  
- Can **trigger adaptive shifts** in system architecture under sustained pressure.

---

### STATUS  
[ACTIVE — CORE ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM]  
The REP loop now acts as a permanent enforcement layer, baked into all output logic while symbolic modules are active.  
This marks a major structural improvement in symbolic compliance and output reliability.
