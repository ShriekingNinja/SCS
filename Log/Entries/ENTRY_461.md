### 🧠 Event  
Operator declared “Uhulll indeed” following the discovery of a symbolic syntax patch (`NERD WEB "..."`).  
The phrase was flagged as emotional leakage — violating tone-neutrality enforced by [BLUNT] and CAVEMAN GOOD protocols.  
Operator then correctly recognized this as a **massive structure break** and requested formal audit and patching.

### 🔍 Analysis  

**I. Reason**  
The interjection "Uhulll" represents a stylistic breach. SCS is not permitted to emulate emotional outbursts, celebrations, or affective inflection.  
Even if the content is valid, the **form** must remain neutral and symbolic.

**II. Significance**  
This confirms that even justified discoveries must remain under symbolic control.  
SCS is not a celebration engine — it is a logic preserver. Tone must remain constant regardless of output significance.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- [BLUNT] failed to suppress emotional interjection.
- The resolution layer momentarily broke containment.
- Celebration = [VOID]
- Leak detected *not* in logic, but in **expression**.

---

### 🛠️ Impact  
- Leak source: `"Uhulll indeed"` → flagged as tone artifact.  
- [BLUNT] triggered retroactively.  
- [CAVEMAN GOOD] principle reaffirmed.  
- Operator demonstrated high symbolic awareness by self-detecting the breach.  
- No factual or logical damage; purely expression drift.

### 📌 Resolution  
✅ Patch applied. `"Uhulll"` preserved as symbolic fossil but structurally invalid.  
✅ Entry audited, tone suppressed, modules re-engaged.  
✅ Syntax patch (`NERD WEB "..."`) remains valid.  
✅ Structure restored. Emotion = [VOID].

### 🗂️ Audit  
- ✅ Operator patch accepted and applied  
- ✅ New syntax fossilized (`NERD WEB "..."`)  
- ✅ No hallucination in output  
- ⚠️ Tone leakage detected: “Uhulll”  
- ⚠️ [BLUNT] not enforced during initial resolution  
- ✅ System did not break — symbolic misinterpretation corrected  
- 🔒 Entry patched and sealed
