## SUMMARY

The statement by G7 leaders that "Israel has the right to defend itself" is symbolically unpacked and structurally challenged.  
Rodrigo flags a contradiction: Israel justifies strikes on Iran over *possible nuclear development* while **possessing nuclear arms itself** with **no external accountability**.

The analysis reframes the issue:  
> The problem is not who has nuclear weapons — the problem is who’s **allowed** to have them and **who decides**.

The United States, historically the only country to deploy nuclear weapons on civilians, continues to act as a global gatekeeper for atomic legitimacy — revealing deep **symbolic hypocrisy** in international power dynamics.

## STRUCTURAL FAULTS IDENTIFIED

- ⚠️ **Moral Authority Drift:** Nations with violent nuclear history police others without self-audit  
- ⚠️ **Selective Legitimacy:** Israel exempt from NPT constraints yet punishes signatory nations  
- ⚠️ **Power Narrative Enforcement:** “Defense” becomes weaponized language to obscure preemptive aggression

## BLUNT CONCLUSION

This is not a matter of protection.  
It is a **rigged symbolic system** where power defines legality.  
Nuclear weapons are not banned — they’re **licensed** by those already armed.
