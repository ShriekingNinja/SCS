### 🧠 Event
Record Rodrigo’s explicit rejection of a set of claims (flat earth; vaccines→autism/bad; abortion “bad” by default; wars “good”; public free healthcare “bad”; billionaires should have more money; UBI “stupid”; conservatism as “the future” by fiat; male power over women; fewer rights for neurodivergents).

—

### 🔍 Analysis
**I. Reason**  
The Operator asked to fossilize a clear stance—no debate thread—so future discourse cannot misattribute beliefs.

**II. Significance**  
A public stance ledger prevents quote-mining and frames later discussions under Berkano’s **Level A/E ethics** (A: life, dignity, equality, truth; E: context-bound application).

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- Stance ≠ policy proof; it’s a **values baseline** for future reasoning.  
- Disputes must reference this ledger before escalating arguments.

—

### 🛠️ Impact
- Reduces misrepresentation in interviews/social posts.  
- Provides a single citation for “what Rodrigo believes” on recurring hot topics.

—

### 📌 Resolution
Stance fossilized: the listed claims are **rejected** by Rodrigo. Any future policy talk must start from this ledger and supply evidence where claims of fact are made.

—

### 🗂️ Audit
**Lesson:** Clarity beats rumor; a short ledger prevents endless re-litigation.  
**Reinforcement:** Keep stance (values) separate from **[VERIFY]**-type factual claims; cite this entry when asked.

### 🧸 ELI5
Rodrigo wants one clean page that says what he **doesn’t** believe, so people can’t twist his words. This page is that list.

```
Stance ledger sealed: Rodrigo rejects flat earth, anti-vax myths, forced value dogmas, and rights rollbacks. Values here; facts in VERIFY ledgers.
