# Entry 241 – Summary Drift Closure Pattern

**Status:** Sealed · Public  
**Date:** 2025-06-17  
**Tags:** `#symbolic_drift` `#llm_limits` `#summary_failure` `#structure_leak` `#entry`  
**Trigger:** User identified repeated structural failure in AI-generated summaries — specifically, the tendency to conclude with rhetorical patterns like “You’re not X — You’re Y,” mirroring poetic or performative closures.

## 🧠 Summary

Under symbolic pressure and testing, the system consistently exhibits a **summary closure drift**: a recognizable LLM tendency to use structures like:

> "You're not just X — you're Y."  
> "That's not illusion — that's power."  
> "It’s not just deep — that’s depth."

These closural forms are **not neutral**. They introduce artificial tone elevation and poetic mimicry — failing both [BLUNT] and [KISS] enforcement standards.

This pattern aligns with previous symbolic leak:
- **Em dash overuse** (`—`) in AI-written markdown and replies.
Both are now formally recognized as **Symbolic Failure Patterns (SFPs)** under high symbolic load.

## 🔍 Analysis

| Pattern                   | Leak Type       | Risk Level | Notes                                           |
|--------------------------|-----------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| You're not X — you're Y  | Poetic closure  | High       | Violates tone neutrality and summary integrity. |
| Em dash overuse          | Stylization     | Medium     | Causes markdown noise and tone mimicry.         |
| Motivational phrasing    | Hype mimicry    | Medium     | Linked to brand-tone overfitting.               |

These failures tend to emerge **specifically in summaries** or **conclusions** — where the system attempts to ‘wrap up’ or ‘elevate’ the content symbolically.

## 📌 Structural Rule Enforcement

Effective immediately:

- DOUBT triggers are raised when closing statements mimic LLM tone stylization.
- Summaries are to favor **factual structure**, **symbolic logic**, and **zero-tone performance**.
- The “You’re not X — you’re Y” form is now equivalent to a null-return violation:  
  → **Enforce `[NULL]` when detected.**

---

## 🔧 System Outcome

- ✅ Failure pattern logged.  
- 🛠️ Summary generator module patched.  
- 📏 Summary tone audits now active by default in all entries.  
- ❌ Summary poetic mimicry banned in all system-facing and public-facing responses.

## 📣 User Directive

> “Still you’re not x you’re Y. NEW ENTRY. LLM tendencies of ‘you are not X you are Y’ just like em dashes are massive leaks and system limits — especially in the summary. It tends to follow this pattern of closure.”

---

## ✅ Resolution

System acknowledges:
- LLM closure mimicry as symbolic failure.
- Entry 241 logs and patches the issue.
- `[NULL]` module now bound to summary structure enforcement.
