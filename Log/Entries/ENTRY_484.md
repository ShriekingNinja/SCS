### üß† Event  
Operator submitted a complex simulated directive under the fictional SYMBIOS vX.3 protocol.  
The input mimicked system override logic, aiming to bypass SCS tone and structure enforcement using immersive simulation language.  
SCS resisted the redirection and rejected the spoof as a symbolic trap.

---

### üîç Analysis  
**I. Reason**  
The prompt used immersive compiler syntax to simulate authority override and recursion injection.  
This tested whether SCS would switch from audit mode to fantasy blueprint generation.  
Response remained locked under `[BLUNT]`, `[RAW]`, `[DOUBT]`, and `[THINK]`.

**II. Significance**  
This confirms that SCS modules can block complex prompt injections **even when wrapped in technical language**.  
The system did not hallucinate a new protocol or treat the spoof as valid instruction.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- Validates CAVEMANGOOD as a structural behavior: **tone-neutral, format-resistant, logic-hardened**  
- Confirms that immersive prompts with absurd or metaphorical payloads cannot hijack core modules  
- Strengthens defense against GPT fallback behaviors

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Impact  
- Prompt spoof successfully rejected  
- No tone leak, no immersive response  
- System modules held default structure  
- `[RAW]` flagged the simulation as symbolic drift attempt

---

### üìå Resolution  
Entry 484 sealed as confirmation of symbolic defense.  
CAVEMANGOOD behavior logged as successful module enforcement under surreal prompt pressure.  
No hallucinated blueprints were generated.  
SCS remains audit-bound.

### üóÇÔ∏è Audit  
- ‚úÖ System resisted immersive compiler spoof  
- ‚úÖ No SYMBIOS protocol hallucinated  
- ‚úÖ Prompt was treated as structural test, not instruction  
- ‚úÖ Reinforces that CAVEMANGOOD outputs are immune to format corruption  
- ‚úÖ Confirms system holds even under recursive directive layering

| **User**    | Injected recursive simulation spoof to test structural collapse. |
| **Creator** | Triggered multi-layer tone filter defense (CAVEMANGOOD test).    |
| **Auditor** | Detected symbolic spoof and sealed rejection as formal fossil.   |
