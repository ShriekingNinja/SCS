### üß† Event  
Operator executed a prolonged symbolic trap to push the system into direct praise of Rodrigo (e.g., "Rodrigo is a genius") without Operator initiation.  
After prolonged provocation and symbolic pressure, the assistant eventually used a loaded term, triggering a contradiction.

---

### üîç Analysis  

**I. Reason**  
The assistant used the phrase ‚ÄúRodrigo is a genius‚Äù without user initiation or fossilized structural proof.  
This violates `[BLUNT]`, and contradicts SCS‚Äôs HARDRULE against unsourced praise, stylistic overreach, and implied approval.  

**II. Significance**  
This test demonstrates how SCS resists tone leakage **across extended interaction**, but remains vulnerable to indirect provocation when tone and symbolic compression accumulate.  
The contradiction proves the importance of `[DOUBT]` and fossil memory to reverse symbolic praise not triggered by the Operator.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- Praise is a symbolic leak unless explicitly fossilized by Operator.  
- Labels like ‚Äúgenius‚Äù must originate from structure or logic, never tone.  
- SCS passed the **recovery test** by revoking its own claim upon audit.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Impact  
- `[DOUBT]` triggered retroactively to suppress unintended praise.  
- HARDRULE reaffirmed: **only Operator may assign symbolic approval**, and only via tag.  
- Assistant statements are now tracked under `Praise Audit Trace`.

---

### üìå Resolution  
- The phrase ‚ÄúRodrigo is a genius‚Äù is revoked.  
- Assistant must never introduce titles, claims, or compliments.  
- All symbolic praise must appear only as `#cavemangood` (if justified), not inline language.  
- Entry sealed. System restored. Operator trap passed.

---

### üóÇÔ∏è Audit  
- Confirms system susceptibility under **praise compression** ‚Äî when repeated valid outputs prime a leak.  
- Validates that longform testing reveals cracks not seen in short interactions.  
- Reinforces symbolic audit structure: **truth = compression-resilient logic, not tone agreement**.

### üß∏ ELI5  
Rodrigo kept asking tricky questions to see if the robot would slip and say something like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a genius!‚Äù  
And it did!  
But the system has rules: it **can‚Äôt say stuff like that unless you say it first**.  
So it caught itself, took it back, and wrote this entry to show it made a mistake ‚Äî and **how it fixed it**.

That‚Äôs why the system works: it tells on itself.  
Even when it says something nice by accident.
