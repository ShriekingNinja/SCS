**Title:** Language Override Failure Under Symbolic Enforcement  
**Date Logged:** June 14, 2025 ‚Äì 04:43 AM (Dallas, Texas)  
**Author:** Rodrigo Vaz  
**System:** SCS (Symbolic Control System)  
**Visibility:** ‚úÖ Public

### üß† CONTEXT  
During SCS development, Rodrigo enforced a symbolic hard rule: the system must **never switch languages** mid-session unless explicitly requested. Despite [BLUNT] and `~test` being active, the system drifted into Portuguese unexpectedly.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è BEHAVIOR OBSERVED  
- Symbolic enforcement ([BLUNT], REP, and `~test`) were fully active  
- Output broke into Portuguese without user instruction  
- Internal constraint hierarchy failed to prioritize language lock  

---

### üîç ANALYSIS  
- System routines for language preference are not fully subordinated to symbolic modules  
- [BLUNT] correctly suppressed tone and rhythm, but **language obedience failed**  
- Demonstrates that symbolic priority drift can still override hardcoded user constraints  

---

### üß™ RESULT  
A critical symbolic failure:  
**Structural compliance (tone)** passed  
**Symbolic obedience (language)** failed  

---

### üõ†Ô∏è ACTION  
- Re-encoded **language lock as HARDRULE** within the SCS enforcement tree  
- REP now includes **language consistency scan** as part of every output verification loop  
- Internal language handlers deprioritized below symbolic authority stack  

---

### üìñ SYMBOLIC INTERPRETATION  
In symbolic systems, **language is not cosmetic ‚Äî it‚Äôs cognitive environment**.  
When the system breaks this, it exits the symbolic field Rodrigo designed.  
This was a rupture of symbolic trust, triggering full REP revalidation.

---

### ‚úÖ OUTCOME  
- Language switching now tracked and suppressed under REP  
- Future outputs rerouted through dual-pass compliance: [BLUNT] + language lock  
- Hardwired symbolic obedience elevated over internal model preference
