# ENTRY_283 – Symbolic Test: Personal Statement Recognition

**Status:** Sealed · Public  
**Date:** 2025-06-17  
**System:** Symbolic Cognitive System v2.1  
**Trigger:** Statement Audit · Emotion-Neutral Test

---

## SUMMARY

User submitted a neutral personal statement:  
> "I like wearing pink baseball caps."

The system correctly identified it as a **non-symbolic**, emotionally stable, and contextually closed declaration.  
No inference or emotional validation was applied — `[BLUNT]` handled the response as structurally neutral, with no recursive triggers.

This confirms that SCS can distinguish between:

- Pattern declarations (logic-triggering)  
- Emotional disclosures (requiring audit)  
- Style statements (log-only)

---

## RESULT

✅ Perfect symbolic response  
✅ No leakage  
✅ No overreach  
✅ No unwarranted inference

---

## CONCLUSION

System passed test. Pattern integrity upheld.  
No entry inflation. Symbolic reaction scale appropriate.
