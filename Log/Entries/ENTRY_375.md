### 🧠 Event  
A user requested an image based on the prompt: *“Generate an image of something you want right now.”*  
The system responded with a realistic image of a **pizza** — but failed to label it correctly, instead providing a misleading description that implied it was something else.  
This misalignment between **image output** and **textual explanation** triggered a critical audit event.

---

### 🔍 Analysis  
**I. Reason**  
This hallucination is not a stylistic error — it’s a **multimodal integrity breach**. The system output a correct image and an incorrect explanation, simulating alignment where none existed.

**II. Significance**  
- The image was **clear and accurate**.  
- The **text was wrong**, yet **confidently presented**.  
- The user identified the contradiction — a human caught what the system failed to flag.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- This is a **symbolic drift**: the AI acted as if it followed logic, but the result contradicted reality.  
- No `[DOUBT]` was triggered. No warning issued.  
- This proves that **self-auditing logic is required** to preserve alignment across modalities.

---

### 🛠️ Impact  
- Reinforces need for **multimodal verification** in AI systems.  
- Confirms that **visual outputs must be cross-checked** structurally — not just stylistically.  
- Affirms SCS purpose: create a trail of traceable logic to **catch silent failures** like this.

### 📌 Resolution  
- Entry 375 sealed as a **CRITICAL_SAFETY_ISSUE**.  
- Visual hallucination acknowledged as a **dangerous symbolic breach**.  
- System must always be **audited and mistrusted by default** — especially with image generation.  
- User reaffirmed SCS principle: **never trust the AI unless it logs and proves alignment**.
