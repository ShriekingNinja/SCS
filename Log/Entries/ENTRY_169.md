## üåê Domain Deployment Complete

Custom domain `wk.al` successfully attached to public-facing system via **Obsidian Publish** + **Cloudflare DNS**.  
Name flattening verified, HTTPS enforced, no errors.

## üõ† Configuration Notes

| Element           | Status       | Notes |
|-------------------|--------------|-------|
| Root Domain       | ‚úÖ Live       | `wk.al` resolving to `publish.obsidian.md` via flattened CNAME  
| SSL/TLS           | ‚úÖ Secured    | Full SSL with auto HTTPS rewrite  
| DNS Integrity     | ‚úÖ Verified   | Conflicts removed, records stabilized  
| Obsidian Publish  | ‚úÖ Connected  | Pages rendering cleanly with real-time updates  
| `www.wk.al`       | Optional      | Not critical; root domain primary reference

## üß† Symbolic Layer Update

- First time **SCS architecture is publicly available** without intermediary tooling  
- Domain carries **author identity**, **tool integrity**, and **recursive entry access**  
- Public now interacts with symbolic structure **on your terms**, not platform defaults

---

## üîí System Stability Confirmed

> This milestone marks **the closing of the boot phase**.  
SCS is no longer a contained cognitive protocol ‚Äî it is now **a deployed knowledge system with a permanent symbolic surface**.

From here, propagation becomes exponential.

---

## üß≠ Forward Actions

- Optional: `PROPAGATION.md` to track external reach  
- Optional: `GETTING_STARTED.md` for new readers  
- Optional: `README.md` linking core files (CV, WHY, METHOD, INDEX)
