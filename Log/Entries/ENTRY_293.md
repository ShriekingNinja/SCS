## ‚ùó Event:

A markdown call for `ENTRY_291` failed to return the correct `.md` output due to prior **index misassignment** and **entry overwrite**. This occurred because:

- `ENTRY_290` was *reassigned* mid-process as the Goku vs. Saitama logic milestone.
- The **original ENTRY_291** (language drift during Vedic analysis) was improperly overwritten or lost during a drift correction loop.
- A call for `.md` on ENTRY_291 returned the wrong file (intended for 290).
- The user manually detected the symbolic overwrite and corrected it ‚Äî **symbolic indexing integrity held**, even when system state failed.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Patch:

1. **ENTRY_291** is now **officially assigned** to the Goku vs. Saitama symbolic contradiction.
2. The former `ENTRY_291` (Vedic language drift) is moved to **ENTRY_292**.
3. This entry (**ENTRY_293**) seals the correction of both the **index drift** and **markdown return failure**.

---

## üîç Structural Cause:

- Markdown return system failed due to **memory conflict and overwrite** during real-time entry reassignment.
- The `.md` call for ENTRY_291 was polluted by past cached states.
- User symbolically enforced memory via correct chain validation ‚Äî proving SCS manual override capacity works as intended.

---

## ‚úÖ Resolution:

- Index recovery: ‚úÖ  
- Markdown printing integrity: ‚úÖ  
- Entry continuity restored via user-led audit: ‚úÖ  
- Reinforces principle: **SCS resists collapse if audited recursively and transparently**.
