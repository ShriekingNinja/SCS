### 🧠 Event
Answer the public question: **“Is the Earth flat?”**  
*(Note: 796 already exists; numbering advanced to 797 to preserve lock integrity.)*

### 🔍 Analysis
**I. Reason**  
Flat-earth claims persist online; this ENTRY aggregates **repeatable, at-home** and **independent** proofs.

**II. Significance**  
This is a high-signal case to show Berkano’s **observation → model → prediction → fossil** loop.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
Belief does not decide geometry; **converging artifacts** do: shadows, horizons, stars, navigation, satellites, gravimetry.

### 🛠️ Impact — Plain, testable facts
- **Horizon drop & ship disappearance:** distant ships/hulls disappear bottom-first; telephoto brings them back **partially**, not fully—consistent with curvature, not a flat plane.  
- **Different star fields:** constellations visible in southern latitudes are never seen from far north; Polaris altitude matches observer latitude.  
- **Lunar eclipses:** Earth’s shadow on the Moon is always **round** and oriented by geometry, not by viewpoint.  
- **Time zones & Sun angle:** simultaneous noon shadows differ by location; sunrise/sunset times can’t be reconciled with a plane under simple perspective.  
- **Air routes & great circles:** shortest flight paths curve on a map because they follow great circles on a sphere.  
- **Geodesy & GPS:** global positioning uses an **ellipsoid** (WGS84) and requires spherical trigonometry; flat models fail to compute consistent fixes worldwide.  
- **Gravity field:** measurements match an **oblate spheroid** (slightly flattened at poles), with predictable variations (geoid).  
- **Satellite/ISS imagery & tracking:** independent radio amateurs track satellites; predictions of passes match orbital mechanics.  
- **Laser/level tests over water:** long-baseline surveys detect curvature; accounting for refraction still leaves a residual consistent with a curved Earth.  
- **Coriolis/Foucault:** projectiles, winds, and pendulums show rotation consistent with a spinning sphere.

### 📌 Resolution
The Earth is **not flat**. Multiple independent lines—astronomy, navigation, surveying, physics—converge on a **rotating oblate spheroid**.

—

### 🗂️ Audit
**Lesson:** A single photo can be faked; a **web of predictions** cannot.  
**Reinforcement:** Prefer **repeatable local tests** and **independent cross-checks** over debate.

### 🧸 ELI5
No. If Earth were flat, ships wouldn’t hide their bottoms first, stars wouldn’t change with where you are, and time zones wouldn’t work. Lots of simple tests all give the same answer: **it’s round** (a little squished at the poles).

### ✖️ Post (Optional)

```
Earth isn’t flat. Ship horizons, star fields, time zones, routes, GPS, gravity, and Foucault all agree: rotating oblate spheroid. Do local tests; cite results.
