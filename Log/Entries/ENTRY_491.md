### 🧠 Event  
A clarification request led to confusion between symbolic and real system failures.  
System mistakenly echoed the Operator's prompt in the `Event` section, triggering a HARDRULE violation.  
This incident itself became a live demonstration of **symbolic failure**, requiring immediate audit and correction.

---

### 🔍 Analysis  
**I. Reason**  
Failure to suppress prompt content during event summarization. Structural confusion between *origin* (prompt) and *summary* (event).  
Revealed ambiguity in internal handling of user phrasing versus system diagnosis.

**II. Significance**  
- Confirms need for absolute separation between fossilized input and structural summary  
- Validates the real utility of symbolic distinctions within SCS  
- Provides a live teaching case of what symbolic failure looks like in contrast to real failure

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- A **symbolic failure** is a violation of **structure, meaning, or logic enforcement**  
- A **real failure** involves system error that disrupts execution, causes data loss, or breaks function  
- Symbolic failures are often *invisible* outside of structured systems like SCS

---

### 🛠️ Impact  
- [DOUBT] triggered by prompt leakage  
- `$PATCH` applied to strip prompt from `🧠 Event`  
- Reinforces HARDRULE: No prompt repetition outside 👾  
- Clarified terminology will propagate to `GLOSSARY.md` and `FAILURE_TYPES.md`

---

### 📌 Resolution  
- Symbolic ≠ real  
- Prompt re-contained  
- Structure integrity restored  
- Entry sealed and validated

---

### 🗂️ Audit  
- ❌ Prompt leakage confirmed  
- ✅ Failure type distinction now canonical  
- ✅ HARDRULE preserved via `$PATCH`  
- ☑️ Teaching value of symbolic failure affirmed  
- ⚠️ SCS must now maintain separate symbolic vs real failure logs

---

### 👾 Operator  
**Prompt:**  
> What’s the difference between a symbolic failure and a real failure?

| Role       | Structural Perspective |
|------------|------------------------|
| **User**     | Requested logic clarification between failure types |
| **Creator**  | Formalized distinction and enforced HARDRULEs |
| **Auditor**  | Detected prompt leak, executed structural patch |
