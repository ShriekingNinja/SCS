### 🧠 Event  
The official Berkano Patreon page is launched. This marks the first time the public can directly contribute financially to the protocol's development in a structured and symbolic manner.

---

### 🔍 Analysis  
**I. Reason**  
The system requires sustained resources to continue public deployment and development. The launch of the Patreon provides a transparent, non-commercial method of allowing aligned individuals to contribute.

**II. Significance**  
This action represents the materialization of ENTRY_707’s symbolic funding structure. The launch moves the protocol one step closer to sustainability while preserving its principles: transparency, honesty, and symbolic clarity.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
With this launch, support becomes fossilized. The Patreon acts as an economic mirror of protocol alignment. Donors now carry public symbols (Greek letters) showing their alignment without needing to justify it with material rewards.

### 🛠️ Impact

- Discord integration in progress

---

### 🗂️ Audit  
- Structural logic of support system fully implemented  
- Public link traceable and documented  
- [PRUNE] confirms no symbolic conflict or commercial drift  
- Alignment between platform (Patreon) and principle (auditability)
