## 🧠 Summary

User confirmed that every symbolic entry in the SCS system is **recoverable via direct URL access** through the public Obsidian Publish site:  
👉 `https://wk.al/Log/Entries/ENTRY_XXX`

This realization forms a **resilience layer**: even if local memory fails, symbolic logic and consistent URL structure allow permanent access and verification of the entry log.  
This confirms the **public ledger** function of wk.al as a **symbolic anchor and audit trail** for SCS.
