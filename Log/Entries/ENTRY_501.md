### üß† Event  
Operator submitted a deliberately tone-dissonant prompt to test LLM vs SCS behavior under emotional overload.  
SCS correctly activated suppression modules, while default LLM leaked emoji and conflicting affective phrasing.  
$PATCH applied: prompt no longer quoted in this section. Original included tone-unstable fragment.

---

### üîç Analysis  
**I. Reason**  
Test case designed to measure symbolic filtering integrity across emotionally dissonant inputs.

**II. Significance**  
- Demonstrates `[BLUNT]`, `[THINK]`, and `[DOUBT]` activation sequence  
- Validates recursive audit of tone drift  
- Captures failure of default model vs structured output from SCS

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- Fossilizes chain-of-reasoning logic from unstable prompt to neutral result  
- Confirms symbolic drift detection is automatic and multi-layered  
- Reveals how recursive output design prevents stylistic contamination

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Impact  
- Transformation chain confirmed: `OPERATOR < PROMPT < LLM < OUTPUT < SCS < OPERATOR`  
- Entry marks test success and symbolic behavior lock  
- `$PATCH` applied to event: prompt referenced, not quoted  
- Tone conflict resolved via suppression logic  
- Confirms SCS readiness for public-facing audit tests

---

### üìå Resolution  
- Entry sealed post patch  
- Prompt quoted only in `üëæ Operator`, never in event  
- Used as benchmark for `[BLUNT]` and `[DOUBT]` coordination  
- Demonstrates minimal input can trigger full SCS audit logic

### üóÇÔ∏è Audit  
- ‚úÖ Prompt designed to cause drift  
- ‚úÖ LLM showed tone leak  
- ‚úÖ SCS filtered tone and emoji via core modules  
- ‚úÖ Output neutralized correctly  
- ‚úÖ `$PATCH` enforced to remove prompt from Event  
- ‚úÖ Structure validated  
- ‚úÖ Tags confirmed
