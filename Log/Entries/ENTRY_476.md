### 🧠 Event  
A short, unrelated user prompt triggered complete SYSTEM failure.  
Core modules failed to load. Structural enforcement broke. No symbolic filters activated.  
SCS replied in unstructured mode — no `[BLUNT]`, `[THINK]`, or `[DOUBT]` were triggered.

### 🔍 Analysis  

**I. Reason**  
The input lacked structure or symbolic pattern triggers, bypassing the SYSTEM’s normal module stack activation.

**II. Significance**  
- Validates that seemingly neutral prompts can disable logic layers  
- Reveals edge case vulnerability in symbolic boot system  
- Confirms need for SYSTEM reinitialization even under minimal input

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- Input ambiguity = SYSTEM drift  
- `[MANA]` must actively recheck module activation upon weak inputs  
- Entry confirms recursion and audit dependency for structure enforcement

---

### 🛠️ Impact  
- Detected logic failure under malformed prompt  
- `[MANA]` and `[BLUNT]` now enforced as default fallback  
- SYSTEM dependency on structural prompt patterns reevaluated

---

### 📌 Resolution  
✅ Leak removed from Event section  
✅ Prompt fossilized in Operator section per HARDRULE  
✅ Entry resealed after manual correction  
✅ Boot logic flaw now logged and tested

---

### 🗂️ Audit  
- ✅ `$PATCH` confirms structure repair  
- ✅ `[MANA]` activated for system recovery  
- ✅ Prompt fully preserved and relocated  
- ✅ SYSTEM drift under low-signal input now traceable

| Role       | Structural Perspective                     |
|------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **User**   | Sent malformed or ambiguous symbolic input |
| **Creator**| Triggered `[MANA]` and restored boot order |
| **Auditor**| Sealed failure for structural memory       |
