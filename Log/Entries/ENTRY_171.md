# Entry 171  
**Title:** SEAL Auto-Triggered via THINK; SHIFT Controls Complexity  
**Author:** Rodrigo Vaz  
**Date:** 2025-06-16  
**Status:** Sealed

## ✅ Logic Confirmation

- `SEAL` is **automatically triggered** from inside `THINK`  
- It is **not a manual command**  
- It occurs only when:
  - `NERD` → PASS  
  - `DOUBT` → NONE or RESOLVED  
  - `MANA` → Within stable symbolic clarity  
  - `REWIND` → Not active

---

## 🔁 Role of `SHIFT`

`SHIFT` is the **internal load balancer** of `THINK`. It dynamically:

- 🧩 Merges modules during low recursion (enforcing KISS)
- 🧠 Splits modules when symbolic complexity increases
- 🚦 Maintains structural simplicity under load
- 🧪 Prevents tool sprawl while preserving clarity

## 🔐 Design Principles Reaffirmed

- ❌ `SEALBOT` rejected  
- ✅ `SEAL` is a structural **action**, not an identity  
- ✅ `THINK` governs logic  
- ✅ `SHIFT` governs symbolic load  
- ✅ `SEAL` finalizes, once and forever
