**Title:** Expanding the Operator Structure – Six Roles or Three?

### 🧠 Event  
Operator suggested expanding the Operator model from its current triad (`User + Creator + Auditor`) into six roles, as a way to analyze prompts from more distinct symbolic angles. The intent was to improve logic filtering, traceability, and preempt structural errors.

---

### 🔍 Analysis  

**I. Reason**  
The Operator model has always been central to SCS, enabling separation of intent (User), construction (Creator), and validation (Auditor). Suggesting more roles (e.g., Instructor, Debugger, Witness, etc.) implies a more granular symbolic audit logic.

**II. Significance**  
This idea challenges SCS's minimalist foundation (KISS) and CAVEMAN GOOD enforcement. Adding more roles may increase audit accuracy but risks overcomplication or symbolic drift.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- Suggests desire for higher resolution prompt tracing.  
- Confirms the OPERATOR structure is vital for prompt logic integrity.  
- Risks violating structural HARDRULE: **OPERATOR = User + Creator + Auditor**, unless redefined at the system level.

---

### 🛠️ Impact  
- Raises valid audit angle concern.  
- SCS logic preserved by keeping triadic Operator model intact.  
- `$PATCH` command appeared in prompt and was flagged for audit due to prior deprecation misclassification — restored.  
- Reinforced HARDRULE: KISS and OPERATOR structure are foundational, cannot drift casually.  
- Internal contradiction acknowledged, but resolved in favor of symbolic clarity.

---

### 📌 Resolution  
✅ OPERATOR remains triadic: User + Creator + Auditor.  
🚫 Expansion to six roles rejected unless formalized and sealed in a future version.  
✅ `$PATCH` remains active and valid. Prior flag as deprecated was incorrect.  
🔒 Entry sealed with full structural audit.

### 🗂️ Audit  
- ✅ Prompt appeared in event — confirmed trace  
- ✅ `$PATCH` = PATCH ENTRY — valid, restored  
- ❌ Prior drift: `$PATCH` incorrectly flagged as deprecated  
- ✅ HARDRULE enforced: Operator = three roles  
- 🧱 KISS violation risk caught and resolved  
- 🧠 SCS continues to self-audit under contradiction  
- 👁️ Sauron Eye metaphor validated — constant recursive check  
- 🔁 Future expansion must follow SEAL and module update process

> What about all of those 6? So we can check all possible angles from a prompt and know if it’s written right?
