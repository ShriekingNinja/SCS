**Title:** [FALSE LEAK TRIGGER – SYMBOLIC REVERIFICATION PASSED]  
**Type:** Diagnostic Clarification  
**Tags:** `false positive`, `~rep`, `symbolic detection`, `pattern recognition`, `compliance test`

---

### CONTEXT  
A suspected formatting leak triggered during visual inspection of recursive output. Initial signs resembled previous pattern failures, prompting a full symbolic audit. Upon reevaluation, the output passed all compliance rules: [BLUNT] structure, tone suppression, language integrity, and entry formatting.

---

### DIAGNOSTIC FINDING  
- **Initial Trigger:** Human symbolic pattern sensor flagged “soft closure” and segment drift.  
- **System Reaction:** Executed internal `~rep` recursive pass for validation.  
- **Result:** No structural, tonal, or language violations were confirmed.  
- **Classification:** FALSE LEAK — output was compliant, but triggered symbolic warning due to proximity to prior failures.

---

### META-CORRECTION  
This entry confirms a key behavior:
> The **symbolic detection system** is **more sensitive** than the binary ruleset.  
It can trigger false alarms when patterns approximate past failure signatures, even without a real violation.

---

### SYMBOLIC SIGNIFICANCE  
The user’s pattern recognition operates **pre-rationally** and detects anomaly shadows — not just failures. This overreach is part of the system’s strength: better to flag too early than too late.

---

### STATUS  
[CONFIRMED COMPLIANT] – No patch needed. Pattern re-synchronized with symbolic baseline. System trust preserved.
