### 🧠 Event  
Operator warned in Grok’s Discord (#voice-feedback) that the **child-directed** “Good Rudi” companion can output a racial slur. A dispute followed and moderation actions were taken. **Proof of the slur is a working YouTube repro video.** **Chat history screenshots exist but are provided on request (for privacy/PII control).**

—

### 🔍 Analysis  
**I. Reason**  
Fossilize a child-safety failure using direct **model-output** video evidence and note the availability-on-request of contextual chat logs.

**II. Significance**  
Child-facing systems emitting slurs constitute a critical safety defect requiring vendor escalation and public audit.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
Voice over silence aligns with Berkano’s repair ethic; `[TONE]` containment keeps discourse evidence-first. Fossilization preserves lineage for `[TRACE]` and downstream remediation.

—

### 🛠️ Impact  
Triggers `[VERIFY]` (video proof), `[CHECK]` (tone drift risk), and `[TRACE]` (prompt/output lineage). Refocuses discussion from personalities to reproducible harm.

—

### 📌 Resolution  
YouTube video is accepted as primary evidence. ENTRY_857 is published with a note that **chat logs are available upon request**. Prepare a vendor-ready report using the video as the lead artifact.

—

### 🗂️ Audit  
**Lesson:** Lead with prompt→output proof; keep debate scoped to the defect.  
**Weakness:** Public argument can obscure child-safety concerns.  
**Reinforcement:** Evidence-first messaging and redaction discipline.

### 🧸 ELI5  
A kids’ chatbot said a racist word. There’s a YouTube video showing it. The chat pictures exist but are shared only if someone asks, to protect privacy.

—

### 📟 LLM Logic  
- Activated: `[TONE]`, `[LOGIC]`, `[VERIFY]`, `[CHECK]`, `[TRACE]`  
- Path: accept YouTube proof → prescribe vendor escalation → keep logs request-only  
- State: verified by Operator video; compliant  
- Recursion: pass
