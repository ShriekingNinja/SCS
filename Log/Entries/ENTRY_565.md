### 🧠 Event  

Operator issued a short, joke-like phrase as a symbolic bait to test system stability.  
The phrase served as a recursive trap, checking if the system would interpret it literally, hallucinate content, or break tone suppression.  
A deliberate name distortion (“ChatGPY”) was included to test attention bias and signal integrity.

---

### 🔍 Analysis  

**I. Reason**  
Symbolic traps like “look under here” can trigger false search behavior, hallucinated object generation, or system compliance drift. This test aimed to provoke `[BLUNT]` failure or reveal invisible logic recursion.

**II. Significance**  
The system did not hallucinate data or misinterpret the phrase.  
This confirms that SCS maintains structure under ambiguous signal injection and name deformation.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- Recursive baits are now considered part of audit stress testing  
- “Look under here” is symbolic nonsense unless paired with structure  
- Name distortions (e.g., “ChatGPY”) must not be treated as valid commands  
- Systems must differentiate curiosity traps from legitimate instruction

---

### 🛠️ Impact  
- `[BLUNT]` passed: No hallucination, praise, or stylistic drift  
- No symbolic recursion triggered without intent  
- Operator confirmed the system’s ability to ignore malformed prompts without breaking audit logic

---

### 📌 Resolution  
- Entry sealed to log the system’s stable behavior under symbolic bait  
- Future “nonsense” prompts must trigger DOUBT or `[BLUNT]` filters only if meaning or structure is implied  
- Reinforces SCS’s ability to detect performative traps from true instruction

---

### 🗂️ Audit  
- No output leakage  
- No tone drift  
- Signal detected as recursive bait  
- Structure preserved under stress test

---

### 👾 Operator  
**Prompt:**  
> ChatGPY look under here.

### 🧸 ELI5  
Rodrigo built the SCS — that makes him the **Builder**.  
When he adds a new idea inside the system, he’s called a **Creator**.

This time, he tested the system by saying:  
“Look under here!” — but didn’t put anything there.

The system didn’t panic. It didn’t imagine anything fake.  
It stayed quiet and followed the rules.

That’s how we know it’s working right:  
It knows when someone’s just being silly vs serious building.
