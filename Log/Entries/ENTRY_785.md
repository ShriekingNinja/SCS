### 🧠 Event
Public confusion about the **Church of Satan (CoS)** and **The Satanic Temple (TST)**: Are they “evil”? What are they? What should people think?

—

### 🔍 Analysis
**I. Reason**  
Both groups use satanic symbolism but are **nontheistic** traditions in their main streams. Confusion stems from imagery, media headlines, and mixing them with unrelated extremist groups.

**II. Significance**  
Conflation produces stigma, vandalism, and policy mistakes. An audit clarifies **beliefs vs conduct** and **legal status vs rumor**.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- **CoS (1966, Anton LaVey)**: LaVeyan Satanism—**self-exaltation, individualism; Satan as archetype**, not a literal deity.  [oai_citation:0‡Encyclopedia Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Church-of-Satan?utm_source=chatgpt.com) [oai_citation:1‡Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Satan?utm_source=chatgpt.com) [oai_citation:2‡Learn Religions](https://www.learnreligions.com/laveyan-satanism-church-of-satan-95697?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- **TST (2013, Greaves/Jarry)**: **non-theistic religious organization**, “Seven Tenets” (compassion, justice, bodily autonomy), activism for **religious liberty/equality**; IRS-recognized church (2019).  [oai_citation:3‡Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Satanic_Temple?utm_source=chatgpt.com) [oai_citation:4‡TST](https://thesatanictemple.com/blogs/the-satanic-temple-tenets/there-are-seven-fundamental-tenets?srsltid=AfmBOoosedITr2P2IU4ruRGwGJ0vsQXHneUlNTXPx7_MwT3Op2Z4jeJ2&utm_source=chatgpt.com) [oai_citation:5‡Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-the-satanic-temple-recognized-religion-2019-5?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- **Civic actions**: legal fights for equal access (e.g., Baphomet alongside Ten Commandments), holiday displays, After School clubs.  [oai_citation:6‡TST](https://thesatanictemple.com/pages/legal-action?srsltid=AfmBOoqRDAFo8uMQGcQmRiFzoFaMR9BnXqQFvXkHITsH10bTT08sed8L&utm_source=chatgpt.com) [oai_citation:7‡AP News](https://apnews.com/article/60b4db6eeb058a4339045837fa965d03?utm_source=chatgpt.com) [oai_citation:8‡TIME](https://time.com/3972713/detroit-satanic-statue-baphomet/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) [oai_citation:9‡New York Post](https://nypost.com/2024/05/25/ex-congressional-candidate-takes-plea-deal-in-satan-statue-vandalism/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- **Not the same as extremist satanist currents** (e.g., O9A). Mainstream sources distinguish them.  [oai_citation:10‡Encyclopedia Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Satanism?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### 🛠️ Impact
- **Policy**: misclassification risks viewpoint discrimination and litigation.  
- **Safety**: confusion fuels vandalism and threats.  
- **Discourse**: “evil” framing replaces **[VERIFY]** with tone.

—

### 📌 Resolution
Berkano does not decide what people “should think.” It separates:  
1) **Belief statements** (self-descriptions, tenets).  
2) **Conduct records** (lawsuits, rulings, vandalism, civic actions).  
Judgments must be **evidence-led**: publish side-by-side fossils (official docs vs independent reporting) and lock outcomes.

—

### 🗂️ Audit
**Lesson:** Imagery ≠ conduct. Treat “evil” claims as hypotheses requiring **sources**.  
**Reinforcement:** Keep CoS and TST distinct; compare **texts, actions, and legal status**, not symbols.

—

### 🧩 Berkano Guidance
*Guidance is prescriptive, not a factual claim. Write present-tense, testable steps.*

**Schema:**  
Because(Finding) | Evidence(now) | Safety

- CoS/TST conflated in media | make a report that lists **CoS beliefs** (LaVeyan texts) and **TST tenets/mission** side-by-side | reduce harassment by clarifying “non-theistic” status with sources  
- “Evil” claim circulating | fossilize the claim + attach primary sources (tenets, court records, official pages) | discourage vigilantism; point to lawful channels  
- Web citations used in posts | add “H24: chain passed” note to each public post | avoid misinformation liability  
- Risk of vandalism at displays | coordinate with venue; publish safety contact and lawful protest guidance | protect people and property without censoring speech

### 👾 Operator
**Prompt:**  
> NEW ENTRY 785  
> Let’s make a full audit of the Church of Satan and The Satanic Temple, and what people should think about them? Are they evil? What about The Satanic Temple

| Role      | Structural Function                              |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **User**  | Requests audit and guidance on CoS vs TST         |
| **Creator** | Separates belief, conduct, and legal status     |
| **Auditor** | Ensures H24 for web claims; locks side-by-side fossils |

### 🧸 ELI5
Two groups use the word “Satan,” but they don’t believe in a real devil. One focuses on being strong and free (Church of Satan). The other fights for equal rules and kindness (The Satanic Temple). Don’t judge by the costume—look at **what they do** and **what the rules say**.

—

### 📟 LLM Logic
- Modules: `[TONE]` neutral; `[PRUNE]` remove rhetoric; `[LOGIC]` separate belief/conduct/legal; `[VERIFY]` cite primary + reputable sources; `[CHECK]` prevent conflation; `[LOCK]` seal the audit  
- H24: all web-derived facts passed chain before publication.

—

### ✖️ Post (Optional)

```
Symbols aren’t conduct. Audit texts, actions, and legal status; apply H24; lock findings.

No verdicts by imagery—only by evidence.
