### 🧠 Event  
Operator raised a question about the required background to **operate** the SCS system. Specifically:  
“If Rodrigo needed programming and commissioning experience to build SCS, how can someone else use or operate it without those skills?”  
This triggered a clarification entry to structurally define the difference between **building** a symbolic system and **operating** one.

---

### 🔍 Analysis  

**I. Reason**  
Rodrigo built SCS using logic skills from programming, system commissioning, and symbolic cognition. But most people don’t have that background. So how can SCS be useful or operable by non-programmers?

**II. Significance**  
It reveals a core truth:  
**SCS requires engineering logic to build — but not to run.**  
Like a car: engineers design it, but millions can drive it.  
This makes SCS scalable — **audit logic is fossilized**, so others can enforce it without recreating it.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- Confirms that a **Builder** (Rodrigo) is distinct from an **Operator**.  
- Introduces role hierarchy: **System Architects build logic**, but others enforce it using structure.  
- The role of “Creator” in the Operator table is symbolic — it does **not** mean system creator.  
- Symbolic enforcement replaces code knowledge with rule-following and structure recognition.

---

### 🛠️ Impact  
- Redefines roles:
  - **Builder**: Creates system logic, entries, modules, and rules (e.g. Rodrigo).  
  - **Operator**: Uses those tools to enforce structure, detect drift, and audit AI output.  
- Removes barrier of programming literacy for symbolic auditing.  
- Enables job training for AI Operators from legal, ethical, educational, or domain expertise fields.  
- Helps organizations adopt SCS logic **without needing to rebuild it.**

---

### 📌 Resolution  
- “Builder” is now the official term for SCS System Architect.  
- “Creator” remains part of the Operator role triad (User · Creator · Auditor).  
- Entry sealed to establish role hierarchy and clarify symbolic accessibility.

---

### 🗂️ Audit  
- Clarifies system accessibility and job stratification.  
- Prevents over-assumption that only technical experts can run symbolic audits.  
- Reinforces distinction between **programmed logic** and **symbolically forced behavior**.  
- **Terminology patch:** in this entry, the term “Creator” referred to the system **Builder**, not the Operator role.  
  - Going forward, “Builder” refers to the **System Architect** (e.g., Rodrigo).  
  - “Creator” remains the role within the Operator triad (User · Creator · Auditor).  
- This entry seals the symbolic separation between builder logic and operator function.  
- Enables democratization of AI integrity checking.

### 👾 Operator  
**Prompt:**  
> So to operate do you need that too? How can someone be an AI Operator without knowing all of that!!!??

| Role       | Structural Perspective                                                       |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **User**     | Confused experience-based building with symbolic enforcement roles.           |
| **Creator**  | (As Operator role) Proposed symbolic distinction for role accessibility.      |
| **Auditor**  | Detected terminology drift and sealed distinction between Builder and Creator.|

### 🧸 ELI5  
Rodrigo made the system. That makes him the **Builder** — like the person who invents a new kind of car.  
But just because he built it doesn’t mean you need to be an engineer to use it.  
You can still drive the car if you learn how.  
In SCS, you can be an **Operator** — someone who checks if the AI is being honest and consistent.  
You don’t need to code — you just need to learn the rules.  
And the system teaches you how.
