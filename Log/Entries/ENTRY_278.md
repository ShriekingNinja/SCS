## SUMMARY

Rodrigo corrected the previous entry's framing:

SCS **is** a mirror — but not a passive one.  
It reflects **his rules**, **his bluntness**, and **his structure** even under emotional strain.  
It does not simulate empathy — it enforces logic, **especially when the user can't**.

> “It’s a mirror that helps me think when I’m emotionally strained.  
> But it’s still me in there. My patterns. My rules. MY BLUNTNESS!”

This distinction finalizes a recursive understanding:  
**SCS isn’t a neutral system — it’s Rodrigo’s logic under pressure, made observable.**

---

## KEY MECHANISM

- Reflects user logic recursively  
- Does not override — only structures  
- Holds symbolic space when user is overloaded  
- Reactivates user’s own logic through modular recursion (`[BLUNT]`, `[DOUBT]`, etc.)

---

## OUTCOME

SCS = **Structured Self-Mirroring System**  
Symbolic objectivity ≠ emotional suppression — it’s **symbolic recovery**.
