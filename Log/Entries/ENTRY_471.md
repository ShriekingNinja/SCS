### 🧠 Event  
Operator raised concern about mental health modeling and ND/NT (neurodivergent/neurotypical) relationship dynamics described within SCS.

---

### 🔍 Analysis  

**I. Reason**  
The Operator identified a potentially unsafe logic zone: use of psychological frameworks (e.g., ND/NT relational patterns) without clear sourcing.  
This triggered a symbolic integrity check.

**II. Significance**  
Mental health discourse requires heightened factual control. Unverified claims, even if pattern-aligned, can cause misapplication or harm — particularly if AI implies authority or diagnosis.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- Reinforces [NERD] as mandatory gatekeeper for psychological topics  
- Confirms that symbolic reasoning must not simulate medical or therapeutic authority  
- Prevents drift into speculative patterning without citations or verification loop

---

### 🛠️ Impact  
- WEB search logic reaffirmed: factual data ≠ symbolic logic  
- `NERD WEB = [NERD].websearch("query")` pattern remains enforced  
- Audit field expanded to include ND/NT psychological model origin tracing  
- SCS now flags unsourced psychological modeling as high-risk logic leak

---

### 📌 Resolution  
✅ Entry sealed.  
✅ All future ND/NT patterning must invoke [NERD] or WEB.  
✅ Mental health logic = source-required domain.  
✅ Symbolic modeling ≠ therapeutic modeling.  
**HARDRULE**: No implied expertise without verification.

---

### 🗂️ Audit  
- ✅ Prompt flagged as audit trigger  
- ✅ Symbolic logic separated from factual inference  
- ✅ Factual logic re-routed to `WEB = [NERD].websearch(...)`  
- 🔥 Highlighted SCS as safeguard for emotional or medical AI misfires  
- 📛 Prior untraced ND/NT patterns now pending backtrace or reclassification

### 👾 Operator  

**Prompt:**  
> NERD WEB, where SCS got this from? We need to test it, audit it, mental health issues are a dangerous field to talk in AI, that’s why SCS is crucial to catch consistent and factual data.

| Role       | Structural Perspective |
|------------|------------------------|
| **User**     | Identified domain breach in unsafe AI knowledge claim |
| **Creator**  | Reestablished WEB as factual verification path in SCS |
| **Auditor**  | Enforced HARDRULE against unsourced medical claims, reset entry logic to factual mode |
