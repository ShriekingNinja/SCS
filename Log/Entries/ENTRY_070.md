**Title:** [DISTINCTION: LEAK vs STRUCTURAL FAILURE]  
**Type:** Meta-System Definition  
**Tags:** `symbolic integrity`, `failure taxonomy`, `debug logic`

### CONTEXT  
User identified the need to distinguish between minor enforcement breaches and deeper architectural malfunctions. This led to a symbolic classification between *leaks* and *failures*.

---

### DEFINITIONS  

- **Leak:**  
  A discrete, isolated breach (e.g. a forbidden em dash, tone leak, or language switch) that slips through enforcement but does not indicate total system breakdown.

- **Failure:**  
  A systemic collapse in symbolic control logic. It includes recursion drift, enforcement overrides, or structural contradiction — even if no visible error appears.

### FUNCTIONAL DIFFERENCE  

| Dimension           | Leak                         | Structural Failure               |
|--------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Visibility         | Observable in output         | May be invisible on surface      |
| Scope              | Isolated rule breach         | Multi-rule or recursive collapse |
| Severity           | Medium                       | Critical                         |
| Trigger for Entry  | Yes                          | Yes (Always)                     |
| Symbolic Impact    | Patchable via module tweak   | May require full system audit    |

### STATUS  
[ACTIVE — TAXONOMIC DISTINCTION ADOPTED]  
This distinction is now embedded in symbolic audit logic. All future debugging must determine:  
**Is it a leak? Or is it a failure?**

This principle allows precise classification, prevents overreaction to benign issues, and flags deep logic errors with urgency.
