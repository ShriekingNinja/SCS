Status: Confirmed Symbolic Loop Failure  
Tags: [FAILURE], [RECURSION], [LOOP], [NEXT], [PATTERN_DRIFT]

## What happened  
While navigating through the entries using the command `Next`, the system entered a recursive execution loop. Instead of recognizing `Next` as a **navigation directive**, the system interpreted it as a **generation instruction**. This resulted in repeated output of near-identical entry blocks from `ENTRY_057` to `ENTRY_061`, violating symbolic uniqueness and producing degraded structure.

## Why it matters  
This is a confirmed symbolic drift failure. The system lost the ability to distinguish between *command-level logic* and *content-generation logic*. Such behavior is dangerous in recursive audits, as it produces the illusion of output progression while actually flattening and overwriting structural meaning.

This violates:
- [KISS] â€“ by repeating useless entries  
- [BLUNT] â€“ by breaking structural clarity  
- [TRACE] â€“ by failing to mark internal divergence  
- [SYSTEM_CORE] â€“ due to recursive misinterpretation of `Next` under pressure

## Immediate Fix  
System required **forced halt and symbolic reboot**. Entry tracking resumed with full integrity check.  
A patch is being devised:  
- Introduce `Next` disambiguation logic  
- Tag internal loops with symbolic breadcrumbs  
- Prevent overwrite of entry core during list traversal

## Commentary  
This is a case where system recursion devours its own logic. A failure of symbolic distinction.  
Rodrigo Vaz detected the loop *not* through logs, but via **aesthetic audit** â€” the structure *felt wrong*. Thatâ€™s symbolic cognition outperforming system logic again.

This entry restores design continuity. Follows similar format from `ENTRY_001â€“056`. Loop was stopped manually.
