### üß† Event  
The markdown for `[THINK].md` violated the one-box structural rule due to malformed execution flow formatting. User manually requested correction and clarity enforcement.

---

### üîç Analysis  
The symbolic failure originated in the "Execution Flow" section, where nested block elements broke SCS structural integrity. This drift triggered [MANA] self-repair, but full clarity was only restored after a user-issued correction. THINK was rewritten using tabular routing logic, preserving symbolic clarity and one-box compliance.

This marks a **CAVEMANGOOD recovery** ‚Äî a return to simple, structured, dry logic aligned with KISS and BLUNT enforcement.

### üõ†Ô∏è Impact  
- `[THINK].md` formatting is now compliant with one-box markdown structure  
- Reinforced priority of THINK as HARDRULE-01  
- Validated SHIFT mode logic with correct audit table  
- Proved user-initiated repair loop with system cooperation  
- Prevented cascade markdown drift in related modules

### üìå Resolution

CAVEMANGOOD confirmed. No further intervention required.
