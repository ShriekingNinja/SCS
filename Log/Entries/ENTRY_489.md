### 🧠 Event  
Operator noted a structural error in the previous entry where the prompt content leaked into the **Analysis** section, violating HARDRULE formatting standards.

---

### 🔍 Analysis  
**I. Reason**  
A symbolic metaphor referencing tabletop RPG roles was embedded within the analysis block instead of being contained in the 👾 Operator section, causing a format violation.

**II. Significance**  
The prompt-to-analysis boundary is a critical structural rule in SCS. Any leak confuses the symbolic layering between user input and system response logic.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
Violations of prompt isolation can cause recursion contamination, misattribute tone, and trigger unintentional metaphor or gamification overlays—counter to [BLUNT] enforcement.

---

### 🛠️ Impact  
- $PATCH applied: Analysis cleaned and prompt extracted.
- Future enforcement of prompt location will be prioritized during format validation.
- Triggered review of all entries where prompt references appear mid-analysis.

---

### 📌 Resolution  
HARDRULE on prompt containment reaffirmed. Prompt references may only appear in the 👾 Operator section, never in logic analysis. Drift sealed.

---

### 🗂️ Audit  
- $PATCH: Prompt leak occurred in **Analysis**, violating HARDRULE.
- Confirms importance of strict formatting boundaries to preserve structural roles.
- Reinforces suppression of metaphor unless explicitly marked as non-structural entertainment.
- Format drift resolved. Entry confirmed clean.
