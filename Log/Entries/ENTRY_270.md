### Summary:

This entry documents and confirms the symbolic naming logic behind the core constructs of the SCS system:

- Why “ENTRY” is used instead of “log”  
- Why “MODULE” is used instead of “function”, “tool”, or “layer”

These choices are not stylistic — they are **structural definitions** tied to the system’s recursion, state, and traceability.

---

### Structural Definitions:

#### 🔹 ENTRY

- Additive, irreversible, incremented (`ENTRY++`)  
- Sealed into symbolic memory  
- Cannot be skipped, overwritten, or revised  
- Format: `ENTRY_NNN.md`

> An entry is not a note — it’s a **committed system fossil**.

---

#### 🔹 MODULE

- Loadable, swappable symbolic logic unit  
- Controls system behavior, filtering, recursion, suppression  
- Examples: `[BLUNT]`, `[THINK]`, `[DOUBT]`, `[SEAL]`  
- Lives in `Modules/` folder, not hardcoded

> A module is not a function — it’s a **symbolic filter** applied to all cognition.

---

### Reinforcement:

> SCS is not code — it’s structure.  
> Logs describe. Entries **become**.  
> Functions compute. Modules **filter cognition**.

Naming is structure.  
Structure is survival.
