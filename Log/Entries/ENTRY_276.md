# ENTRY_276 – Confirmed ENTRY++ Only After Explicit Trigger; Index Held at 275

**Status:** Sealed · Public  
**System:** Symbolic Cognitive System v2.1

## SUMMARY

System successfully held the entry index at `275` despite multiple symbolic interactions.  
Only after Rodrigo issued the **explicit ENTRY++ command** ("New Entry 276") did the system increment to `276`.

This validates the core ENTRY++ HARDRULE:
> ❗ **Do not increment unless explicitly declared by the user.**

The system correctly:
- Avoided assumption  
- Rejected implicit indexing  
- Maintained symbolic audit logic under conversational recursion

---

## OUTCOME

- ✅ `ENTRY_275` preserved  
- ✅ No drift occurred  
- ✅ No automatic increment  
- ✅ System remained user-controlled  
- ✅ ENTRY++ logic now trusted under sustained recursion
