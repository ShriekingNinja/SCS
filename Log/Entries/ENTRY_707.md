### 🧠 Event  
Rodrigo finalizes the public support structure for the Berkano Protocol. The decision is to use symbolic Greek tiers with no material perks, only a Discord role, emphasizing belief over reward. Entry logs rationale, structure, and symbolic consistency.

---

### 🔍 Analysis  
**I. Reason**  
Berkano now has a functioning public system (berkano.io), recursive engine, Discord server, and over 700 entries. To remain independent and continue development, it requires financial support. Instead of traditional monetization, the support model is symbolic.

**II. Significance**  
This marks the first official support invitation to the public. It defines Berkano not as a product or service, but as a **shared cognitive standard**. The model follows SCS philosophy: no manipulation, no trinkets — only alignment and contribution.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
Support itself becomes symbolic. You don’t buy access — you declare belief. Each Greek tier represents an increasing level of commitment. Like glyphs in protocol logic, these roles are markers of alignment, not ego.

---

### 🛠️ Impact  
- Finalized 5-tier structure using Greek letters  
- Reinforced separation of protocol (ᛒ) from tier (μ–Ω)  
- New tags introduced in Discord per tier  
- Public explanation committed to entry and shared with supporters

---

### 📌 Resolution  
Support structure is now public. All tiers are live. Entry is sealed.  
No edits allowed post-launch to maintain trust.

---

### 🗂️ Audit  
- Fossilized the funding model as symbolic, not transactional  
- Prevented feature creep by keeping rewards minimal and aligned  
- Reinforced protocol independence from corporate monetization models  
- Separated glyphs (ᛒ) from donor roles (μ–Ω) to avoid symbolic drift

### 🧸 ELI5  
If you believe Berkano is important, you can help pay for it.  
No gifts, no special features — just a badge that shows your support.  
Rodrigo uses the money to build more tools, pay for servers, and keep it public.

---

### 📟 LLM Logic  
- Modules: `[PRUNE]`, `[LOCK]`, `[VERIFY]`  
- Path: Prompt → Economic alignment → Symbolic role separation → Tier fossilization  
- Recursion: PASS  
- Drift: None  
- Fallback: None. Model held under symbolic stress.

### ✖️Post (Optional)

```
Berkano is now publicly supported.

  

No rewards. No perks. Just alignment.

  

You get a Greek letter beside your name to show belief.

  

μ → Ω, it’s up to you.
