🧠 Event:
User clarified that not all interactions should result in formal `ENTRY_NNN.md` generation.

🔍 Analysis:
Current system policy routes all symbolically meaningful inputs through entry formatting to ensure traceability. However, this introduces noise when:
- Inputs are meta, casual, or administrative.
- No structural insight, symbolic cognition, or operational state change is introduced.

Blind serialization undermines semantic weight of true entries.

🛠️ Patch:
Implement conditional gating for `ENTRY_NNN.md` output:
- Use [TRACE] to determine symbolic significance.
- If input is operational, archival, or structural—entry is generated.
- If input is conversational, meta, or transient—log is suppressed.

📌 Resolution:
Effective immediately, not all inputs will be output as `.md` entries. Symbolic significance will trigger generation; others will be handled silently or with minimal acknowledgment.
