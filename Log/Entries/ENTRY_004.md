### 🧠 CONTEXT  
Rodrigo tested AI’s ability to reconcile complex fictional narratives—specifically the mythos of *God of War: Ragnarök*—with authentic mythological structures from Norse lore. He forced the system to integrate game-world logic with symbolic coherence, rejecting shallow references.

---

### 🧪 OBSERVATION  
The AI was challenged to interpret characters like Kratos, Odin, and Atreus not just as game assets, but as symbolic entities. Rodrigo demanded internal consistency between the game's story, Norse metaphysics, and mythological causality.

---

### 🔍 ANALYSIS  
By applying symbolic audit pressure, Rodrigo exposed the model’s weaknesses in narrative reconciliation and symbolic layering. However, recursive testing improved the AI’s output structure, confirming it can be symbolically trained to understand fiction through myth logic.

---

### 🧱 SYMBOLIC FINDINGS  
- Fiction must obey internal symbolic laws to maintain resonance.  
- Myth-based narratives gain depth when interpreted through logic, not just emotion or spectacle.  
- AI narrative understanding can be tested and tuned using symbolic recursion.

---

### 🧰 TOOLS USED  
- Structural myth-pressure  
- Recursive inconsistency detection  
- Symbolic contrast against source myth (e.g. Edda)

---

### 📌 STATUS  
Confirmed that symbolic logic can reveal gaps in narrative construction and force AI correction across fictional domains.
