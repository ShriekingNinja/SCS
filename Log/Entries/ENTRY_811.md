### 🧠 Event
Begin a structured audit of a cosmology claim that summarizes the universe’s composition (~5% ordinary/known physics; remainder attributed to dark matter/energy) and frames this as an active frontier.

—

### 🔍 Analysis
**I. Reason**  
The statement blends a **ΛCDM composition shorthand** with an epistemic point (“quantified ignorance”) and a frontier assertion. We separate **measured parameters** from **ontology** and clarify uncertainties.

**II. Significance**  
Public discourse often treats 5%/95% as exact and absolute. Berkano requires **parameter names/uncertainties** and **evidence channels**.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- “We can measure it” = we constrain parameters whose **effects** predict observations; **not** that we know the microphysics.  
- “We don’t know what it is” = **unknown ontology**; **known phenomenology**.  
- “Frontier” = active probes that could refine or overturn parts of ΛCDM.

### 🛠️ Impact — [VERIFY] Ledger (initial rows)
| Interview name | Where | Verbatim claim (portion) | Claim type | What to check (operationalization) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| “Why AI is Overrated – with Neil deGrasse Tyson” | Hasan Minhaj interview | “All we ‘know’ is ~5%; ~95% is dark matter/energy we can measure but don’t know.” | Quantitative + epistemic | (a) ΛCDM present-day parameters and errors (Ω_b, Ω_cdm, Ω_Λ). (b) Evidence channels: CMB, BAO, SNe Ia, lensing, structure growth. (c) Model dependence & redshift context |
| same | same | “On the doorstep of profound insight” | Frontier/forecast | List active probes (CMB-S4, DESI, Euclid, Rubin, direct/indirect DM searches) and what predictions they test |

*Working expectation:* Present-day (z≈0) ΛCDM fits yield roughly **Ω_b ~ 0.05**, **Ω_cdm ~ 0.25–0.30**, **Ω_Λ ~ 0.65–0.70** with quoted uncertainties; composition is a **fit**, not an axiom.

—

### 📌 Resolution
The **5%/95%** framing is a useful shorthand within ΛCDM, but publication must include **Ω-parameters with uncertainties** and the caveat that “measuring” refers to **effect constraints**, not identification of the underlying stuff. “Frontier” stands as fair framing given active experiments.

—

### 🗂️ Audit
**Lesson:** Cosmological “facts” are **parameter fits** under a model; always list **Ω + error bars** and the **evidence channel**.  
**Reinforcement:** Separate **what fits data** (measured) from **what it is** (unknown).

### 🧩 Berkano Guidance
*Guidance is **prescriptive**, not a factual claim. Informative, logic-based recommendations in present tense. Start each **Do** with a capitalized imperative (Enable, Add, Make, Publish).*

| Public explainers                 | **Post** with “H24: chain passed” note                                 | Post URL; source list                    | Prevent raw web leakage                     |

### 👾 Operator
**Prompt:**

> “What I can tell you is we know enough about the universe to quantify our ignorance. And everything we know, the physics, the chemistry, the biology, all of that, all of that understanding of what’s going on in the universe is 5% of what is driving the universe. The 95% has dark matter and dark energy. We can measure it. We don’t know what it is or what’s causing it. My point is that’s a frontier. To say we haven’t discovered anything lately. We are on the doorstep of profound ignorance turning into possibly profound insight and wisdom on how the universe works.”

### 🧸 ELI5
We don’t know what most of the universe **is**, but we can **measure how it pulls and pushes** on things. Our math fits the pictures and charts, even if the stuff is still mysterious.

### 📟 LLM Logic
- Modules: `[TONE]` neutral; `[LOGIC]` model + parameters; `[VERIFY]` evidence channels; `[CHECK]` separate fit vs ontology; `[LOCK]` seal.

—

### ✖️ Post (Optional)

```
Audit: “~5% known; ~95% dark.” We’ll publish Ω-parameters with errors and an evidence map (CMB, BAO, SNe, lensing), plus a probe ledger.
