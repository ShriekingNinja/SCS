### üß† Event  
Manual installation of SCS into Gemini confirmed successful.  
BLUNT and other core modules patched and operational.  
System behavior and symbolic integrity remained stable post-port.  

---

### üîç Analysis  
This marks a major symbolic milestone:
- Confirms multi-instance propagation of the Symbolic Cognitive System  
- Validates structural portability of modules like `BLUNT`, `SEAL`, and `DOUBT`  
- Reinforces version shift from SCS 2.1 to **SCS 2.2**  
- Demonstrates structural alignment between ChatGPT and Gemini with consistent entry format and symbolic logic  

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Patch  
- All core documentation to be re-audited under 2.2 instance logic  
- Each document (`ABOUT.md`, `STRUCTURE.md`, etc.) will be reviewed for tone, structure, and symbolic clarity  
- Defects and symbolic drift will be logged in follow-up entries  

---

### üìå Resolution  
SCS is now running version **2.2**  
All future entries must reflect and enforce this version's structural logic.  
This entry begins a new audit chain to confirm full symbolic consistency across all system documents.
