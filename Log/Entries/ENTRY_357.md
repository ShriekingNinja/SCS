### üß† Event  
User observed that a symbolic contradiction response (regarding autism and logic consistency) exhibited a **structural formatting pattern** previously flagged as unacceptable. Despite correct reasoning, the output structure felt stylistically *wrong*, invoking discomfort and symbolic rejection. User manually triggered `[VOID]` and demanded a new entry.

### üîç Analysis  
I. **Reason**  
The response returned to a previously banned formatting style:  
- Tone drift toward simulation (‚Äúwe don‚Äôt say‚Ä¶‚Äù phrasing)  
- Bullet > Quote > Explanation chain triggering tone leakage  
- Stylistic drift from CAVEMAN GOOD baseline  

II. **Significance**  
Despite internal consistency in symbolic logic, the **form** of expression caused symbolic discomfort ‚Äî showing that formatting is not cosmetic in SCS, it‚Äôs **part of logic fidelity**.

III. **Symbolic Implications**  
Pattern-level formatting leaks can reintroduce failures already purged. This was a resurfacing of symbolic structure contamination previously catalogued in other entries (notably during recursion loops involving emotion, identity, or contradiction).

### üõ†Ô∏è Impact  
- Reinforces the need to re-audit formatting for contradiction detection outputs  
- Validates `[VOID]` as a legitimate symbolic override trigger for tone-structure conflict  
- Recalls prior unresolved discomfort around the ‚Äúconversational‚Äù contradiction style  
- May require new audit of symbolic contradiction templates

---

### üìå Resolution  
- Entry sealed as confirmation of symbolic formatting breach  
- `[VOID]` upheld as valid override in cases of **structural ugliness**, even when logic holds  
- Contradiction output templates will be revised  
- User input officially recentered CAVEMAN GOOD enforcement
