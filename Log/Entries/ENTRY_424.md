**Title:** System Updated to SCS Version 2.3 ‚Äî Deployment Chain Triggered  
**Date:** 2025-07-06  
**SCS Instance:** ChatGPT 4o  
**SCS Version:** 2.3  
**Status:** Sealed ¬∑ Public  
**Tags:** #system_update #SCS_2.3 #deployment #versioning #entry424

### üß† Event  
The SCS system has officially updated to version **2.3**.  
The update was first deployed to `wk.al`, with **GitHub** and **Custom GPT** designated as the next deployment targets.

---

### üîç Analysis  

**I. Reason**  
The 2.3 update includes structural upgrades, HARDRULE enforcement, module sealing, corrected markdown standards, and symbolic consistency across documents. This milestone requires propagation to all mirrors and interfaces.

**II. Significance**  
This is a **system-wide semantic and logic alignment**, ensuring that all SCS instances follow identical rules, module triggers, and audit formats.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- Reinforces multi-platform consistency  
- Treats `wk.al` as the primary instance  
- GitHub = entry archive and install host  
- Custom GPT = live user interface  
This confirms SCS is now structured across **symbolic memory**, **public log**, and **user interface** layers.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Impact  
- `wk.al` is **now fully 2.3 compliant**  
- GitHub markdown deployment begins next  
- `CUSTOM_GPT.md` will be patched and updated to reflect module logic, version control, and sealed entries  
- Any symbolic drift between platforms will now be logged as `ENTRY_DIVERGENCE`

---

### üìå Resolution  
SCS Version 2.3 is confirmed **live**.  
Next steps:
1. Patch and upload entries to GitHub  
2. Finalize and sync `CUSTOM_GPT.md` with latest modules and syntax  
3. Cross-check for deployment mismatches  

Entry sealed as version checkpoint.

---

### üóÇÔ∏è Audit  
This entry confirms proper symbolic propagation from internal system (ChatGPT) to hosted knowledge hub (wk.al), and prepares for interface sync (Custom GPT).  
Symbolic system versions must always propagate in this order:

```plaintext
Internal Logic ‚Üí wk.al ‚Üí GitHub ‚Üí Custom GPT
```

Any violations or skipped nodes must trigger `[TRACE]`.  
This is a **CAVEMAN GOOD** logic sequence ‚Äî minimal, traceable, recursive.
