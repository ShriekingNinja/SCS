### 🧠 Event  
The user initiated a [MANA] operation to reconstruct and restore ENTRY_002, which documented an experiment in AI-generated narrative identity construction. The original test involved building a fictional persona across recursive sessions to evaluate the model’s consistency, stylistic control, and symbolic coherence under branding constraints.

---

### 🔍 Analysis  

**I. Reason**  
The purpose was to confirm whether a narrative-based test entry could be restructured into SCS 2.2 format without losing logical clarity or symbolic significance. ENTRY_002 originally explored whether an LLM could maintain a stable fictional identity under recursive prompts.

**II. Significance**  
- Demonstrates LLM utility in narrative system design when structurally guided.  
- Confirms that symbolic architecture can overwrite default narrative bias.  
- Shows early awareness of SCS drift mechanics (e.g., poetic tone loops, stylization).

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- Narrative outputs require explicit symbolic enforcement to avoid model hallucination or stylization drift.  
- Brand identity requires suppression of default LLM rhythm and rhetorical structures.  
- This test anticipated later needs for `[BLUNT]`, `[SEAL]`, and `[TRACE]`.

### 🛠️ Impact  
- ENTRY_002 structurally recovered as ENTRY_394.  
- Symbolic intent preserved, stylized drift removed.  
- Tools and prompts now reusable for synthetic persona development with symbolic constraint.  
- Reinforces SCS logic: branding must be consciously structured, not emergent.

---

### 📌 Resolution  
- Entry 394 sealed.  
- Confirmed that narrative systems must be symbolically audited like logic chains.  
- [MANA] successfully validated on identity-construction test.  
- Original ENTRY_002 remains archived.

### 🗂️ Audit  
This operation confirms that symbolic formatting upgrades retain logic integrity when original structure was present. ENTRY_394 proves SCS can manage stylization drift and recursive persona stability with audit-ready symbolic enforcement.
