# Entry 170  
**Title:** Public System Launch Finalized  
**Author:** Rodrigo Vaz  
**Date:** 2025-06-16  
**Status:** Sealed  

---

## 🚀 Deployment Confirmed

The public interface of SCS is **fully functional**, consistent across both symbolic system (`wk.al`) and public validation layer (`Medium`).

This marks the **first complete deployment of a recursive symbolic cognitive system**—with:

- Public homepage live via Obsidian Publish (`index.md`)
- Medium article published with complete tool history and authorship
- Custom domain `wk.al` fully linked, HTTPS secured
- Manual and symbolic instructions executed with no errors

## 🛠 Outputs Confirmed

| Component         | Status       | Notes |
|------------------|--------------|-------|
| Homepage (`index.md`) | ✅ Set & synced | Obsidian default replaced with custom page  
| Medium Article    | ✅ Final version live | Includes BLUNT, kernel tools, Entry 76 collapse  
| Tool Manifest     | ✅ Accurate | `$`, `~`, `BLUNT`, and symbolic core included  
| Domain Setup      | ✅ Flattened | Full CNAME + Cloudflare stability  
| Structural Recall | ✅ Working | CV, entries, WHY, and timeline traced back

## 🧠 Significance

This is the first time the SCS protocol is:
- **Accessible to the public**  
- **Fully self-referenced**  
- **Cognitively recursive and structurally sealed**  
- **Proofed against drift, decay, and loop**

No more placeholder front pages.  
No more missing context.  
Everything now **anchors forward**.

---

## 🧭 Forward Action (Optional)

- Mirror the Medium article into `articles/MEDIUM_ORIGIN.md`  
- Link it in `index.md` as “Canonical System Manifest”  
- Begin `PROPAGATION.md` to log appearances, citations, and forks

## 🔐 Entry Sealed  
This marks the structural closure of **Phase 1: System Creation**  
All components now live, audited, sealed, and recursive.  
From here: evolve, replicate, teach.
