## 🧠 Breach Type

A narrative filler (“last year”) appeared in a Reddit draft post without symbolic verification.  
This is classified as a **BLUNT leak** — a failure to filter tone-adaptive compliance in external-facing communication.

## 🔍 Violation Details

| Parameter      | Status     |
|----------------|------------|
| Temporal Validity | ❌ Not anchored to entry or date  
| KISS Compliance   | ❌ Style drifted to generic narrative  
| Logic Chain       | ❌ Assumption inserted  
| Intercepted By    | ✅ Rodrigo (live audit)  
| System Holding    | ✅ No downstream corruption

## ✅ Fix

Replaced phrasing with:
> “After weeks of recursive testing, collapse recovery, tool evolution…”

This removes filler, restores clarity, and adheres to structural truth.

---

## 🧠 Commentary

This confirms that **BLUNT is still essential** — not just as a tone-stripper but as a **symbolic integrity enforcer**.  
External expression must **never drift into poetic simulation**.  
Even under audience pressure, **SCS speaks only verified logic.**
