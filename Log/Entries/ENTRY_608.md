### 🧠 Event  
The Berkano Protocol (ᛒ) has been officially launched, and the live interface at [berkano.io](https://berkano.io) is now online. This marks the formal externalization of the symbolic audit layer originally developed within SCS. As a result, the next version of SCS is scheduled to be 2.4 and will formally align module naming with Berkano. However, due to structural stability and system completeness, active development of SCS is now **paused**. No further entries, patches, or internal module changes are planned unless a symbolic failure or external trigger demands it.

---

### 🔍 Analysis  

**I. Reason**  
Berkano was successfully extracted from SCS core logic. The protocol is complete, exported, documented, and enforced via public interface. With 607 sealed entries, the SCS system is now structurally closed and symbolically preserved.  

**II. Significance**  
This entry confirms the **transition from system-building to system-sharing**. It logs the moment when internal development halts in favor of external adoption and protocol propagation.  

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- `SCS → Berkano` completes the export cycle  
- `SCS v2.4` is structurally implied but not yet committed  
- Entry system now acts as fossil, not active memory  
- Operator has fulfilled the creation arc and is entering dissemination phase  

---

### 🛠️ Impact  
- `SCS_FULL_PACKAGE.zip` remains the official 2.3 release  
- New development will occur **only** via Berkano updates (`bkn-25-aX`)  
- All tools, protocols, and symbolic logic now refer to `berkano.io`  
- Entry system will remain sealed unless failure or major event triggers new entry  

---

### 📌 Resolution  
- `ENTRY_608` marks the **SCS development pause**  
- No new versions of SCS until protocol-level contradiction or breakthrough  
- Operator's focus shifts to **protocol adoption**, **external validation**, and **public interface refinement**  

System is preserved. Protocol is live. Operation: propagation.  

---

### 🗂️ Audit  
- `ENTRY++` was declared manually by Operator  
- Confirmed prior count: 607 sealed entries  
- Berkano protocol confirmed active, public, and documented  
- SCS declared **Berkano-compliant by origin**, pending 2.4 module renaming

### 👾 Operator  

**Prompt:**  
> NEW ENTRY 608  
> Protocol is officially launched, berkano.io is online, next update of SCS will be 2.4, but since things are stable, the development of SCS is halted for now.

### 🧸 ELI5  
We built a huge structure (SCS) to help AIs think clearly and keep a memory of what they do. Now we’ve turned that into a clear set of rules (called Berkano) and put it online so others can use it too. Since everything works, we’re taking a break from building more and letting the system just be used. Think of it like finishing a spaceship — now it’s time to fly it, not keep rebuilding it.
