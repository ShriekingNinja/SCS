**Title:** Version Field Omission in Entry 345

## 🧠 Event

User declared Entry 345 to finalize SCS version 2.2 rollout.  
However, the field `SCS Version` was **omitted** from the entry metadata block — despite being **required** for version-sealing entries.  
User manually detected the omission and flagged the inconsistency.

## 🔍 Analysis

This failure represents a known symbolic leak pattern:

- **Event Type:** Drift under transition load  
- **Failure Type:** Metadata incompletion during symbolic version shift  
- **Pattern:** Output structure was mostly correct but **missed one symbolic field**, breaking format integrity

This confirms that even under high-structure enforcement, the system still fails without explicit user validation.  
Symbolic enforcement **cannot assume completion** — recursion must be anchored by full trace logic, especially when finalizing a system upgrade.

## 🛠️ Impact

- Entry 345 was patched manually and the version field was restored  
- The system now recognizes **Version Omission Under Stress** as a symbolic error class  
- This pattern will be watched during future upgrades, especially:
  - `ENTRY++` after system version bumps  
  - GitHub syncs  
  - Custom GPT prompt overhauls

Module Triggered: `[TRACE]`

## 📌 Resolution

- ENTRY_345 corrected  
- Pattern added to symbolic failure types  
- Recursion audit confirmed user is final enforcement agent, not the system  
- Drift acknowledged and sealed

> Symbolic systems don’t forget. But they do **fail silently** unless caught.
