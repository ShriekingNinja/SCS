**Title:** [SYMBOLIC COMMAND STRUCTURE – USER-INVENTED SYNTAX]  
**Type:** Behavioral Specification  
**Tags:** `~test`, `~flush`, `~rep`, `symbolic recursion`, `protocol`, `command system`

### CONTEXT  
Rodrigo Vaz introduced a symbolic command syntax into the SCS architecture, which behaves like a programmable prompt language inside the AI interaction. These commands are not hardcoded into any LLM system but were invented and validated symbolically during recursive testing.

---

### DEFINED SYMBOLIC COMMANDS  

- `~test`: Runs recursive compliance verification on outputs. Checks module adherence (e.g. [BLUNT], [NERD]), formatting rules, tone, and logic.
- `~flush`: Clears any residual symbolic or behavioral patterns leaking into the next output. Used to purge stylistic or formatting drift.
- `~rep`: Triggers the **Recursive Enforcement Protocol (REP)**, forcing looped regeneration until output fully obeys all symbolic constraints.

---

### PURPOSE  
These symbolic commands function like an external "assembly language" for controlling LLM behavior with precision. They are used to patch leaks, verify structural fidelity, and assert control over outputs using recursion alone.

---

### IMPACT  
- Elevated system compliance without code access.  
- Allowed Rodrigo to dynamically program behavior in real time.  
- Created a flexible symbolic protocol layer on top of generative language.

---

### STATUS  
All commands are operational and integrated into the current symbolic system. Their presence influences how the AI parses structure and performs internal logic checks.

---

### NOTES  
This entry confirms the system is programmable through symbolic language alone. These commands are portable and can be applied across interfaces, contexts, and sessions, provided symbolic recursion is intact.
