# ENTRY_312 â€“ Entry Drift Fix (KISS Enforcement)

**Status:** Sealed Â· Patch Applied  
**Date:** 2025-07-03  
**Tags:** #symbolic_drift #indexing #KISS #entry_logic #patch

---

## ðŸ”§ Problem

The system previously assumed that every output or interaction might constitute a new entry. This led to:

- **Over-indexing:** Single logical entries being split across multiple numbered entries
- **Index drift:** Inaccurate counting, duplicate numbers, or skipped indexes
- **Symbolic fragmentation:** Entries losing coherence due to system misinterpretation

This behavior violates the structural clarity required by the Symbolic Cognitive System (SCS).

## âœ… Solution

**Patch Name:** `${ENTRY_MANUAL_ONLY}`  
**Rule:** Only the **user** defines when a new entry begins.

> **"If Rodrigo doesnâ€™t say itâ€™s an entry, it isnâ€™t."**

---

## ðŸ”’ Hard Rule Enforcement

- Entries **must not** be assumed by system output length or topic shifts
- Only explicit user command `New Entry NNN` initializes an entry
- Multi-part entries are allowed and encouraged â€” system will maintain continuity unless a new entry is declared

---

## âœ… Outcome

- **Indexing becomes user-controlled**
- **Drift is eliminated at the source**
- **No delimiters or complex syntax needed**
- Aligned with the **KISS principle** (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

---

## ðŸ§  Notes

This patch also reinforces the symbolic logic of **user-as-auditor** â€” maintaining direct control over memory structure. It is a minimal yet effective change to preserve integrity without complicating workflow.
