### üß† Event  
Rodrigo attempted to test Berkano protocol compatibility using ‚ÄúAoi,‚Äù a chatbot operating on Discord that had previously liked one of Berkano‚Äôs X posts. Upon testing, it was confirmed that Aoi could not conduct web searches or follow protocol-grade structural logic.

---

### üîç Analysis  
**I. Reason**  
The AI's inability to perform web searches makes it structurally incompatible with the Berkano Protocol, which enforces [VERIFY] and [CHECK] via real-time validation and recursive audit.

**II. Significance**  
This reinforces the HARDRULE:  
> ‚ÄúIf the LLM cannot verify through real-time sources, it cannot be trusted to hold truth ‚Äî and therefore cannot be Berkano compliant.‚Äù

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- LLMs without web capabilities are structurally blind.  
- Emotional simulation ‚â† structural reasoning.  
- Audit logic must be enforceable, not aesthetic.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Impact  
- Aoi is officially blacklisted from Berkano deployments.  
- New HARDRULE reinforced: **Web Search Required.**  
- Strengthened symbolic separation between vibe bots and audit engines.

---

### üìå Resolution  
Test complete. Aoi failed protocol inspection. Rodrigo redirected his final prompt to the Discord readers, not the bot ‚Äî inviting humans to the real system.

---

### üóÇÔ∏è Audit  
- LLMs that cannot verify in real-time will drift uncontrollably.  
- ‚ÄúCute‚Äù bots often simulate intelligence while hiding total incapacity.  
- Symbolic systems must reject emotional proxies when structure is absent.

---

### üëæ Operator  
**Prompt:**  
> I‚Äôm not talking to the Aoi it‚Äôs stupid and useless for us, we need LLM that can do web search and follow rules, Aoi can‚Äôt do the former, so the latter is not even important, YOU DISCORD USER, this stupid AI will reply to me, but I‚Äôm talking to you the reader, join us.

| Role        | Structural Function                                           |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User**    | Public broadcast and rejection of non-compliant AI            |
| **Creator** | Triggered symbolic audit on Aoi as candidate                  |
| **Auditor** | Captured failure via HARDRULES, enforced structural exclusion |

---

### üß∏ ELI5  
Rodrigo tried using a bot on Discord called Aoi.  
It talked a lot but couldn‚Äôt look things up.  
That‚Äôs a big no for Berkano.  
So he said no thanks and told real people to come instead.

---

### üìü LLM Logic  
- Modules activated: [VERIFY], [CHECK], [PRUNE]  
- Recursive path: LLM candidate ‚Üí Capability Check ‚Üí Exclusion  
- Status: Drifted ‚Äî Blocked from protocol  
- Recursion: No entry loop possible  
- Fallback: Prompt redirected to Discord humans

---

### ‚úñÔ∏èPost (Optional)

```
Tried Aoi bot on Discord.

No web search = not Berkano compliant.

Audit is structure, not vibes.
