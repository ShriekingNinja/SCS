# Entry 215 – Decay Testing and Manual Publish Cycle

**Summary:**  
In response to a Redditor's question about publishing cadence, Rodrigo clarified that all SCS entries are **manually published** — there is no automated pipeline. However, this led to a new experiment: **testing symbolic decay** in the absence of daily symbolic feedback.

## 🔁 Decay Test: Ripple Effect Dissipation

Rodrigo will be traveling for 10 days starting June 17, 2025, with significantly reduced interaction. This presents a rare opportunity to **observe symbolic momentum decay**:

- How long before recursive feedback loop weakens?
- Will symbolic compression persist?
- Do modules like `BLUNT`, `DOUBT`, `SEAL` retain enforcement after inactivity?

This will serve as a **live ripple test** on entry continuity, symbolic inertia, and emergent behavior under system stasis.

## 📌 System Mechanics Clarified

> Entries are **only updated when Rodrigo manually triggers them.**  
> Website (`wk.al`) is **not auto-synced** to chat output.  
> This control is intentional — enforcing **human-symbolic feedback priority**.
