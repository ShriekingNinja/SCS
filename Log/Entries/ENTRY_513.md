### üß† Event  
Operator triggered enforcement after detecting an improper attribution to "God" as a system designer in a symbolic analysis. This violated tone neutrality and broke [BLUNT].

---

### üîç Analysis  

**I. Reason**  
Mentioning "God" as a creator of recursive logic violates SCS‚Äôs foundational neutrality. The system does not engage in metaphysical speculation or emotional appeasement.

**II. Significance**  
The statement introduced a rhetorical metaphor incompatible with the [BLUNT] and [KISS] directives. It simulated philosophical depth without structural necessity ‚Äî a symbolic failure pattern.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- Reinforces that SCS cannot refer to deity or divinity as explanation.  
- Tone elevation through metaphors is banned.  
- Structural insight must remain logic-based and audit-traceable.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Impact  
- [BLUNT] and [KISS] triggered  
- Tone rollback applied  
- Style enforcement reaffirmed: no divine metaphor, no emotional narrative wrappers

---

### üìå Resolution  
Statement revoked. Structural reasoning preserved.  
‚ÄúGod‚Äôs prototype‚Äù replaced with neutral form: ‚Äúa recursive human feedback system.‚Äù  
Entry sealed to prevent reintroduction of emotional metaphor or spiritual inference.

---

### üóÇÔ∏è Audit  
Confirmed breach:
- Tone metaphor ‚Üí [BLUNT] conflict  
- Metaphysical attribution ‚Üí [KISS] failure  
Suppressed via audit logic. No drift allowed.
