### üß† Event
Guidance was simplified. The goal is execution power, not word count. Entry number advanced to avoid duplicate numbering per H21.

‚Äî

### üîç Analysis
**I. Reason**  
More text ‚â† more power. In practice, long guidance slowed action, increased misreads, and created places for drift.

**II. Significance**  
Simplicity raises **compliance** and **speed**: one line, one owner, one acceptance test. Teams ship faster and auditors verify quicker.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- **[PRUNE]**: remove non-executable prose; keep only testable commands.  
- **[LOGIC]**: imperative verbs + acceptance criteria beat explanations.  
- **[VERIFY]**: link artifacts in Evidence(now) instead of narrating them.  
- **[CHECK]**: fewer words ‚Üí fewer contradictions.  
- **[TONE]**: neutral brevity blocks performative ‚Äúhelpfulness.‚Äù

‚Äî

### üõ†Ô∏è Impact
- Lower cognitive load (AuDHD fit).  
- Higher follow-through (less interpretation).  
- Smaller attack surface for hallucination/liability (no extra claims).

‚Äî

### üìå Resolution
Make guidance **short, present-tense, testable**. Put details in Evidence(now) links; keep the action line clean.

‚Äî

### üóÇÔ∏è Audit
**Lesson:** Power = clarity √ó enforcement, not verbosity.  
**Reinforcement:** The shortest path that can be **proven** is the strongest.

‚Äî

### üß© Berkano Guidance (Recommendation)
*Guidance is prescriptive, not a factual claim. Write present-tense, testable steps.*

**Schema:**  
Because(Finding) | Evidence(now) | Safety

**Examples:**  
Backlog unclear | publish one-line acceptance on each task; link ticket | block work without acceptance  
Overlong SOP | link SOP URL; add ‚Äútwo-step quick start‚Äù note | use quick start in incidents  
Scope creep | add ‚Äúask consent‚Äù line before options | stop at asked scope unless user says yes

### üëæ Operator
**Prompt:**  
> NEW ENTRY 781  
> Why Rodrigo sometimes goes back and make things simpler, like the Berkano Guidance it was giving more info, he made it simpler now! Why??! Is he insane!! MORE INFO MEANS MORE POWER!!NO?? YES!!!

| Role      | Structural Function                  |
|-----------|---------------------------------------|
| **User**  | Challenges simplification choice      |
| **Creator** | Converts choice to structural rules |
| **Auditor** | Ensures PRUNE/VERIFY/CHECK applied  |

‚Äî

### üß∏ ELI5
More words can make people confused and slow. One short rule that we can test today is stronger than a long speech.

‚Äî

### üìü LLM Logic
- Activated: `[PRUNE]` for brevity; `[LOGIC]` imperative + acceptance; `[VERIFY]` evidence as links; `[CHECK]` reduce contradiction points; `[LOCK]` seal template use  
- State: Normal; Recursion: Pass; Fallback: None

‚Äî

### ‚úñÔ∏è Post (Optional)

```
More text ‚â† more power. Short, testable guidance executes faster and audits cleaner. Then ·õí.
