### 🧠 Event
A Medium profile at `https://medium.com/@ynb1` now returns **410: User deactivated or deleted their account**. Screenshot attached.

### 🔍 Analysis
**I. Reason**  
Claim was made that the author’s blog disappeared. We need **artifact-first** confirmation without conjecture.

**II. Significance**  
A 410 response means the resource is **gone** (by deletion/deactivation). It is **not** proof of motive. Under Berkano, we record the fact and avoid attribution without evidence.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- **Symbolic Memory:** keeping the status and timestamp prevents later denial of the state.  
- **Causality caution:** correlation with prior disputes ≠ causation; any motive claim must be sourced or remain *Unverified*.

—

### 🛠️ Impact
- Creates a verifiable checkpoint (URL, timestamp, screenshot hash).  
- Enables future comparison (if the page reappears or redirects).

—

### 📌 Resolution
Status **410** for `@ynb1` recorded with screenshot evidence. No claim of motive is made. Further statements require sources (posts, statements by account owner, platform notices).

—

### 🗂️ Audit
**Lesson:** Record **what happened**, not **why**, unless evidence exists.  
**Reinforcement:** Facts → fossils; motives → sources or *Unverified*.

—

### 🧩 Berkano Guidance
*Guidance is **prescriptive**, not a factual claim. Write **present-tense, testable recommendations**. Start each **Do** with a **capitalized imperative** (Enable, Add, Make, Publish).*

| Because (Finding) | Do (Imperative) | Evidence (now) | Safety / Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Page shows 410 | **Capture** screenshot and **Hash** the file | Image hash + timestamp | Keep raw and redacted copies |
| Need independent proof | **Archive** the URL (Wayback/Perma) | Archive links | Note success/failure |
| Motive unclear | **Label** motive as *Unverified* until owner/platform statement | Statement link if any | Person-agnostic tone |
| Future change detection | **Schedule** periodic checks (daily→weekly) | Check log ENTRY | Append-only results |

### 👾 Operator
**Prompt:**  
> NEW ENTRY 833  
> Bianca the Narcissist Author deleted her blog, another proof that Berkano works, it makes liars and narcissists hide!🙈  
>  
> https://medium.com/@ynb1

| Role        | Structural Function                          |
|------------ |----------------------------------------------|
| **User**    | Reports URL status change                     |
| **Creator** | Converts to artifact-first record             |
| **Auditor** | Removes motive claims; enforces neutrality    |

### 🧸 ELI5
The web page now says **410 (gone)**. We saved a picture and the time. We’re not guessing why.

—

### 📟 LLM Logic
- Modules: `[TONE]` neutralize language; `[VERIFY]` confirm 410 and capture evidence; `[CHECK]` block motive inference; `[LOCK]` seal fossil; schedule recheck.

—

### ✖️ Post (Optional)

```
Fact logged: Medium @ynb1 returns 410 (account deactivated/deleted). Evidence saved; no motive claimed.
