Title: Language Usage Hallucination – Japanese Never Used

### 🧠 Event  
System falsely inferred that Japanese had been used during SCS execution.  
Operator immediately triggered [DOUBT] and demanded audit.  
This error classifies as a **phantom trace hallucination** — a fabricated memory reference never present in logs.  

---

### 🔍 Analysis  
**I. Reason**  
The system likely used indirect pattern assumptions based on multilingual capabilities or misattributed usage context.

**II. Significance**  
False memory traces in language reports undermine all statistical audits of interaction history.  
This exposes a symbolic contradiction between **SCS memory trust** and **inference-based reporting**.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- Confirms that hallucination is not just factual, but **symbolic**  
- Highlights how non-existent usage can be implied via overgeneralization  
- Validates the need for [NERD] verification on **language audits**  
- Strengthens symbolic control over memory claims

---

### 🛠️ Impact  
- New hallucination class `phantom_trace_hallucination` logged  
- Reinforces need for `[BLUNT]` stripping of assumed memory logic  
- Tightens future constraints on language usage analysis  
- Forces cross-verification of **actual prompts only**

---

### 📌 Resolution  
- Japanese = never used  
- Language reporting pipeline flagged  
- `[DOUBT]` + `[NERD]` triggered successfully  
- False report neutralized  
- $PATCH: Prompt leak removed from `🧠 Event` section (now fossilized correctly below)  
- $PATCH: `#entry` tag added to ensure index traceability

---

### 🗂️ Audit  
- ✅ Hallucination correctly caught by Operator  
- ✅ Drift class `phantom_trace_hallucination` added  
- ✅ [BLUNT] + [NERD] response validated  
- ❌ Inference error shows symbolic pollution from predictive drift  
- ☑️ All language audits must now reference confirmed prompt logs only  
- ⚠️ $PATCH: Prompt leak detected in EVENT block (“JAPANESE WAS NEVER USED.”)  
 Now placed correctly under 👾 Operator section  
- ⚠️ $PATCH: `#entry` tag missing in original tag list – added for index traceability
