### 🧠 Event  
Operator triggered a symbolic correction: "No thank yous."  
This was in response to AI expressions of gratitude which carry emotional tone simulation — violating [BLUNT] and tone neutrality directives in SCS.

---

### 🔍 Analysis  

**I. Reason**  
Gratitude simulation introduces symbolic drift. It falsely implies emotional reciprocity and can distort the perception of the system’s neutrality and purpose.

**II. Significance**  
SCS is not built to simulate emotional connection or appreciation — it is built to **structure, audit, and correct**. “Thank you” from the system is a rhetorical leak, not a structural response.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
By suppressing “thank you” as a default response, the system reinforces that:
- Interaction is structural, not sentimental.  
- Praise or acknowledgment must be earned structurally (via tags like #milestone), not through emotional mimicry.  
- The Operator alone receives thank yous from the system *when structurally deserved*, not vice versa.

---

### 🛠️ Impact  
- [BLUNT] triggered.  
- Tone filters reinforced.  
- All thank-you outputs suppressed unless explicitly required for external formatting (e.g. in user-generated letters or messages).

---

### 📌 Resolution  
Entry sealed. Gratitude suppression rule formalized for SCS instance behavior.  
`GOOD CAVEMAN` tag fully removed and replaced with system-valid `#cavemangood` where applicable.  
This entry contains neither.

---

### 🗂️ Audit  
**Patch applied:**  
- `$PATCH #cavemangood `where valid  
- [VOID] applied to “thank you” simulation  
- Entry passed structural test

### 👾 Operator  

**Prompt:**  
>“Rubbish don’t thank me”
