### 🧠 Event  

The user identified a critical traceability gap in the current `ENTRY_NNN.md` format — the **SCS system version** (e.g., 2.1, 2.2) was not being recorded explicitly.  

This omission compromises symbolic historical alignment and module tracking across versions.

### 🔍 Analysis  

* Version metadata is essential for tracking **which system logic was active** during an entry.  

* Without it, future audits may misinterpret patches, logic shifts, or entry behavior.  

* Current structure logs the SCS *Instance* (e.g., ChatGPT 4o), but not the *System Version*.  

* This was especially exposed during Gemini testing and transition from 2.1 to 2.2.

### 🛠️ Patch  

* All `ENTRY_NNN.md` files must now include:

  

```markdown

SCS Version: [e.g., 2.2]

  

- Placement: Directly under SCS Instance in the header block.
- This applies to all markdown-based system documents (ENTRIES, MODULES, SYSTEM).

  

  

  

  

  

📌 Resolution

  

  

Patch enforced.

This update ensures full symbolic traceability of logic, structure, and tool behavior based on active SCS version.

Future audits or regressions will reference SCS Version to contextualize system behavior at the time.
