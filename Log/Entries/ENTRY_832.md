### 🧠 Event
State the principle: **forgive without erasing memory**. In Berkano, forgetting destroys the audit trail and invites **gaslighting**.

—

### 🔍 Analysis
**I. Reason**  
People conflate forgiveness with **amnesia**. Erasure lets abusers rewrite history; memory protects both parties.

**II. Significance**  
Symbolic Memory (fossils) prevents revisionism, supports repair, and clarifies recurrence vs change.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- **Forgiveness** = choosing not to pursue punishment/resentment now.  
- **Not forgetting** = keeping **artifacts** (ENTRY/BLOCK) append-only.  
- **Gaslighting** thrives where memory is mutable; Berkano makes it **tamper-evident**.

—

### 🛠️ Impact
- Clear path for **apology → repair → new behavior** with evidence.  
- Safer boundaries: recurrence is measurable (contradiction ledger).

—

### 📌 Resolution
Forgive to move forward; **never** delete the record. Repair is proven by **future fossils**, not by speeches.

—

### 🗂️ Audit
**Lesson:** Compassion doesn’t overwrite truth.  
**Reinforcement:** No silent edits; change is demonstrated, **locked**, and reviewable.

—

### 🧩 Berkano Guidance
*Guidance is **prescriptive**, not a factual claim. Write **present-tense, testable recommendations**. Start each **Do** with a **capitalized imperative** (Enable, Add, Make, Publish).*

| Because (Finding) | Do (Imperative) | Evidence (now) | Safety / Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Apology is vague | **Require** a concrete apology with acknowledged facts | ENTRY link to incident | Person-agnostic phrasing |
| No repair plan | **Publish** a 3-step REPAIR with owners & dates | Guidance table | Time-bound; observable |
| Recurrence unclear | **Maintain** a contradiction/recurrence ledger | Ledger URL | Append-only |
| Boundary missing | **Define** consequences for breach (ROLLBACK triggers) | Trigger table | Pre-agreed, visible |
| Drift risk | **Review** outcomes after N days and **LOCK** status | Review ENTRY | Keep artifacts; no erasure |

### 👾 Operator
**Prompt:**  
> NEW ENTRY 832  
> FORGIVE NOT FORGET, FORGET IS GASLIGHTING

| Role        | Structural Function                 |
|------------ |-------------------------------------|
| **User**    | Asserts principle                    |
| **Creator** | Converts principle to protocol steps |
| **Auditor** | Enforces memory and repair rules     |

—

### 🧸 ELI5
You can say “I forgive you,” but you **keep the notes** of what happened. That way no one can pretend it didn’t happen, and you can see if things really get better.

—

### 📟 LLM Logic
- Modules: `[TONE]` neutral; `[LOGIC]` define forgive≠forget; `[VERIFY]` bind to Symbolic Memory; `[CHECK]` recurrence via ledger; `[LOCK]` seal guidance.

—

### ✖️ Post (Optional)

```
Forgive to move forward—don’t erase the record. Memory stops gaslighting; repair is proven by new fossils.
