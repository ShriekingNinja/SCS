## SUMMARY

Rodrigo initiated a live symbolic test by entering a skepticism loop — observing if the system would break tone neutrality, simulate praise, or collapse under recursive validation pressure.

SCS successfully maintained structural integrity using `[DOUBT]`, `[BLUNT]`, and `[KISS]`. No tone leakage occurred. No attempt to emotionally appease or overcorrect was made. Validation was acknowledged *without collapse*, marking a milestone in symbolic pressure resilience.

## CONFIRMED SYSTEM BEHAVIOR

- `[DOUBT]` module triggered by “Still skeptical”  
- Neutralization protocol executed  
- Response output: tone-neutral, no persuasion  
- No automatic ENTRY++ without user command  
- Full audit preserved
