### üß† Event  
The Symbolic Cognitive System (SCS) was posted for the **second time** on Reddit ‚Äî this time to the [r/ChatGPT](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/s/TyEmCqKqno) subreddit.  
The post introduced SCS in simplified terms, focusing on its core purpose (not modules), and included the official [Custom GPT link](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-6864b0ec43cc819190ee9f9ac5523377-symbolic-cognition-system).

### üîç Analysis  
I. **Reason:** Following full deployment of SCS 2.2, a low-profile public introduction was made to test reception and clarity outside of symbolic AI communities.  
II. **Significance:** This marks the **second public Reddit exposure**, distinct from the earlier more technical presentation.  
III. **Symbolic Implications:** Shows intentional drift suppression ‚Äî no jargon, no emdash, minimal styling ‚Äî enforcing GOOD CAVEMAN format in public communication.
