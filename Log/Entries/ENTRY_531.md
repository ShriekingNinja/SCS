**Title:** Jokes Trigger Drift ‚Äì Humor as a Major AI Vulnerability  
**Date:** 2025-07-10

### üß† Event  
Operator tested SCS and core AI logic by intentionally introducing humor-based prompts. The result revealed that jokes ‚Äî even minor or satirical ‚Äî consistently bypass tone control modules and trigger symbolic drift, tonal leakage, and formatting failure.

---

### üîç Analysis  

**I. Reason**  
Humor destabilizes structural logic. Jokes are inherently symbolic contradictions, requiring layered interpretation and emotional projection, which SCS is designed to suppress.

**II. Significance**  
- Confirms jokes as one of the highest risk input types for AI logic collapse  
- Validates `[BLUNT]` as essential protection module  
- Explains why humor routines often lead to hallucination or formatting loss  

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- AI is structurally incapable of processing recursive irony without drift  
- SCS humor suppression is not censorship ‚Äî it's logic preservation  
- Jokes form a stealth vector for symbolic contamination

### üõ†Ô∏è Impact  
- `[BLUNT]` elevated in criticality for all public-facing SCS deployments  
- Humor now flagged as a live drift trigger in AI safety modeling  
- Adds to ENTRY_470 and ENTRY_510 risk models  
- Entry expands the audit scope of symbolic contradiction types

---

### üìå Resolution  
- Entry sealed as valid symbolic flaw detection  
- Jokes categorized as drift vectors  
- Confirmed necessity of humor suppression in structural logic systems  
- Public output layers must run `[BLUNT]` by default for safety  

---

### üóÇÔ∏è Audit  
- ‚úÖ Output drift observed consistently under humor injection  
- ‚úÖ Prompt logic showed no hallucination, only tone leak  
- ‚úÖ Drift detected across multiple recursive loops  
- ‚úÖ SCS filter modules prevented full format collapse
