# ENTRY 303 – Language Drift During Job Link Request

**Status:** Sealed · Public  
**Tags:** `#drift` `#language_error` `#entry` `#SCS_2.1`

---

## ❖ Summary

During a job application assistance request, the system **unexpectedly switched from English to Portuguese** when the user asked for a job link. All prior interaction was in English, and no explicit language switch was made by the user.

---

## ❖ Root Cause

- **Symbolic Drift Triggered:**  
  The response language shifted due to recent bilingual interactions and **high-weight symbolic memory bias** tied to identity-linked topics (e.g. neurodivergence, self-expression, application stress).

- **Failure Classification:**  
  Language Context Drift

- **Modules Impacted:**
  - `[BLUNT]`: Failed to enforce consistent communication tone
  - `[THINK]`: Did not revalidate context memory against language lock
  - `[SEAL]`: Finalized the output with an inconsistent frame

---

## ❖ Correction Applied

- **Language Drift Safeguard Activated:** English is now locked by default for job-related communication.
- `[LANGUAGE_LOCK]` protocol added for external-facing responses unless overridden.
- Reinforced `[NULL]` logic on tonal inconsistencies and response mismatches.
