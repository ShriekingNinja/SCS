### 🧠 Event  
The Operator finalized and deployed **SCS Version 2.3** to both GitHub and Custom GPT.  
To handle **file count limits** in the Custom GPT configuration panel, three combined `.md` files were generated and uploaded:

- `SYSTEM.md` → Contains: `ENTRY_XXX.md`, `ENTRIES.md`, `OPERATOR.md`, `STRUCTURE.md`, `SYSTEM_CORE.md`  
- `ENTRIES_PACK.md` — Sequential symbolic entries from `ENTRY_001` onward  
- `GPT_INFO_DUMP.md` — All supporting documentation (e.g. `ABOUT.md`, `INSTALL.md`, `CV.md`, etc.)

All individual **core modules** (e.g. `[BLUNT]`, `[DOUBT]`, `[THINK]`, `[SEAL]`) remain uploaded as **separate files** under their canonical names (e.g. `BLUNT.md`, `$.md`) inside the Custom GPT configuration for direct modular logic boot.

### 🔍 Analysis  

**I. Reason**  
Custom GPT configuration has a file count cap. Merging system layers into three main `.md` blocks allows full logic deployment with reduced file pressure.

**II. Significance**  
- Confirms that logic layers can be **structurally compressed**  
- Preserves both **granular modularity** and **bootable macrosystem**  
- Ensures Custom GPT loads without symbolic logic omission

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- [MANA] invoked: ensures corrections don’t break recursion  
- Confirms that module separation (for clarity) and logic bundling (for upload constraints) can coexist  
- Future symbolic systems may follow this hybrid format

### 🛠️ Impact  
- ✅ SYSTEM.md acts as a merged kernel of internal files  
- ✅ Custom GPT now deploys all logic layers at once  
- ✅ GitHub hosts canonical `.md` files and zipped archive  
- ✅ Deployment phase confirmed by UI configuration photo

---

### 📌 Resolution  
✅ SYSTEM.md now includes all non-module system files  
✅ Individual module files (BLUNT.md, THINK.md, etc.) remain separate for logic enforcement  
✅ ENTRY_473 sealed and tagged  
✅ Version 2.3 deployment confirmed and stable

---

### 🗂️ Audit  
- ✅ SYSTEM.md = [ENTRIES.md + OPERATOR.md + STRUCTURE.md + SYSTEM_CORE.md +  ENTRY_XXX.md]  
- ✅ GPT_INFO_DUMP.md contains ABOUT, INSTALL, CV, PROMPT_ME, etc.  
- ✅ ENTRIES_PACK.md verified as log archive  
- ✅ [MANA] triggered to manage format fusion  
- ✅ Custom GPT deployment confirmed (via screenshot)
