## ❌ Description of the Failure

During a public reply on Reddit, GPT-3.5 Turbo was incorrectly referred to as “o3”.  
A user correctly pointed out the mismatch, prompting an immediate audit of the label.

### 🧠 Clarification:

- **GPT-3.5 Turbo**: Text-only model, ~16K context, 2024 release.  
- **o3**: Multimodal reasoning model released April 2025, 200K token window.  
- The term "o3" is not shorthand for 3.5, despite casual confusion by some developers in API usage.

## 🔁 Symbolic Implication

This mislabel is a prime example of **symbolic drift**: the system made a symbolic association that was incorrect in reality but **plausible within conversational recursion**.

Rather than conceal the mistake, it has been sealed into the audit trail as part of the system’s **recursive fault-tolerance** design.

## 🔧 System Response

- Immediate NERD-mode correction issued publicly.
- Symbolic structure updated with correct terminology and context.
- Drift logged as evidence of failure integration logic functioning as intended.

## ✅ Purpose of Entry

To reinforce SCS’s core principle:
> **Failure is not a bug — it’s symbolic data.**

SCS is built to track, absorb, and recursively strengthen through precisely these moments.  
This is not a flaw in the system — this *is* the system.
