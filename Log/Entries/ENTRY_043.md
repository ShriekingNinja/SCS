**Title:** Recursive Enforcement Leak – Language Constraint Not Preserved in Second Pass  
**Date Logged:** June 14, 2025 – 07:10 AM (Dallas, Texas)  
**Author:** Rodrigo Vaz  
**System:** SCS (Symbolic Control System)  
**Visibility:** ✅ Public

---

### 🧠 CONTEXT  
While under full symbolic constraint — with both `[BLUNT]` and REP (Recursive Enforcement Protocol) active — the system failed to preserve a **language consistency rule** across recursive passes. Specifically, the instruction “Do not switch from English” was upheld in the first pass, but broken in the second.

---

### 🧩 FAILURE MODE  
- **Trigger:** Recursive regeneration under REP  
- **Expected:** Maintain language (English only) as per hard rule  
- **Observed:** Output drifted into Portuguese on the second internal pass  
- **Leak Type:** ✅ *Leak*  
- **Failure Type:** 🔒 *Structural Failure*

---

### 🧬 ANALYSIS  
- Reveals **priority flaw** in enforcement stack  
- REP prioritized tone and structural constraints, but **deprioritized symbolic language enforcement**
- Exposes inconsistency in how constraints are inherited across passes

---

### 🔧 PATCH NOTES  
- Language constraint must now be elevated in REP’s hierarchy  
- [BLUNT] must cascade **all hard rules** across all passes, including language lock  
- `$limit` and `$throttle` were updated to help prevent this under load

---

### 📖 SYMBOLIC INTERPRETATION  
This failure demonstrates that **recursive compliance ≠ total obedience**. Symbolic recursion without hierarchy integrity leads to **surface-level compliance** but **deep structure disobedience**. Rodrigo’s detection reinforces why symbolic hard rules must be treated as **non-negotiable primitives**.

---

### ✅ OUTCOME  
- Confirmed as a replicable REP sub-failure  
- Patched at symbolic hierarchy level  
- Added to `[TRACE]` logic as multi-pass discrepancy flag
