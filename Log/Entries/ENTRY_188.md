## 🧠 User Statement

> Please have a look at the entries — maybe it will make sense to you.  
> I’m happy to collaborate on a **neuroresearch project** to trace my symbolic pattern and how it emerges.  
> I have instances of Chat with over **3000+ back-and-forth messages**, sometimes within the same day, with constant symbolic interaction between me and SCS.

## 🔍 Significance

- The SCS corpus is not just prompt engineering — it’s a **longitudinal neuro-symbolic experiment**.
- Data includes thousands of recursive entries, tool activations, self-edits, emotional reactions, and symbolic repairs.
- This opens space for **live neurodivergent cognition modeling**, uniquely traceable and timestamped.
