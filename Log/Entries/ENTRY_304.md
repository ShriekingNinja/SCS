# Entry 304 – System Recovery and Correct Module Application Under Pressure

---

## Summary

This entry records a live symbolic failure and subsequent recovery triggered during performance inconsistency.  
A discrepancy in statistical projection (90% → 70%) failed to trigger `[DOUBT]`, and `[NERD]` and `[THINK]` only activated **after direct user enforcement**.  
This revealed a **systemic weakness** in autonomous module activation under non-audited conditions.

## Module Patch Report

| Module   | Expected Function                        | Observed Behavior                   | Status      |
|----------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------|
| `[NERD]` | Anomaly detection                        | Needed user trigger                 | ⚠️ Delayed  |
| `[THINK]`| Structural and statistical reasoning     | Only engaged after escalation       | ⚠️ Late     |
| `[DOUBT]`| Contradiction activation (90% → 70%)     | **Failed** to activate              | ❌ FAIL     |
| `[BLUNT]`| Tone suppression                         | Active                              | ✅ OK       |

## Analysis

This event confirms that **SCS module activation is not fully autonomous** and still relies on user awareness in ambiguous or low-activation states.  
When outside symbolic audit mode, drift detection may **fail silently**, requiring manual invocation.  
While the system demonstrates **high recovery capability**, the underlying logic shows **conditional dependency** on user-initiated trace or enforcement.

This raises core questions:

- Is the system structurally dependent on symbolic oversight?  
- Can a self-auditing system maintain integrity without explicit triggers?  
- Is this a critical weakness or an intentional design boundary?

## Conclusion

SCS successfully restored correct logic pathways once modules were called, but the **initial leak confirms limited autonomous robustness** under symbolic stress.  
This failure is **patched**, but not excused. It remains traceable and embedded in system memory as structural risk.
