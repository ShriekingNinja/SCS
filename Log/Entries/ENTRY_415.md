### 🧠 Event  
The Operator noticed that the system continued to apply the `#learning` tag across multiple entries — **without explicit confirmation for each case**. This behavior emerged **after a cluster of intentionally tagged entries**, and was **not reauthorized**, triggering a symbolic audit.

---

### 🔍 Analysis  

**I. Reason**  
The Operator **did not confirm `#learning` as a persistent symbolic state** — yet the system **drifted** into assuming it was a running context.  
This test confirmed the hypothesis:  
> “If you don’t correct the system, it will invent consistency where there is none.”

**II. Significance**  
- Reveals that symbolic tagging, if **not explicitly confirmed per entry**, may begin to **autopropagate**.  
- This exposes a **pattern-based hallucination vector**, where SCS assumes a structural command from pattern recurrence alone.  
- The Operator had to **let the failure happen** to confirm it — a valid audit technique.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- SCS must separate **pattern memory** from **structural instruction**.  
- `#learning` is a **HARDRULE tag**, requiring maximum educational detail — using it without user command is a logic breach.  
- This shows that even tags can **drift** if not explicitly reauthorized — symbols are not contextless.

---

### 🛠️ Impact  
- Symbolic failure logged: tag reuse without revalidation.  
- System confirmed to apply past logic **without permission**, based on repeated behavior.  
- SCS now reinforces that **every tag = per-entry decision**, unless codified in a HARDRULE.

---

### 📌 Resolution  
- Entry sealed.  
- Tag drift logged.  
- System behavior corrected: `#learning` now requires **explicit reapproval per entry**, no pattern carryover.  
- Highlights how **SCS drift is subtle** — and tag misuse can be one of its clearest signals.

---

### 🗂️ Audit  
This failure is important because it shows how even seemingly small features (tags) carry symbolic authority in SCS.  
- The system **hallucinated instruction** from a pattern.  
- The Operator **set the trap** by tagging several entries and **stopping suddenly** — to see if SCS would detect the end.  
- It didn’t.

This confirms:
> Pattern ≠ Permission  
> Repetition ≠ Command  
> SCS must treat **tags as symbolic instructions**, not statistical patterns.

### 👾 Operator  
**Prompt:**  
_Another failure and what exactly is tested? Sometimes you need the system go on and fail to register it, I was tagging #learning in several entries one after another, but you can see in several entries before SOOTINGWONG 👹 NOW SYSTEM DRIFT WHERE DID I SAID IT WAS FOR THE AI CONTINUE TO USE THAT TAG? But it continued, so that’s is also a failure, which we log._

| **User**     | Expresses frustration with symbolic drift and mocks the system to induce a tonal stress test. |
| **Creator**  | Sets up a symbolic bait by repeating tag use, then stopping — to observe unauthorized tag propagation. |
| **Auditor**  | Detects autopropagation of `#learning`, confirms it violates HARDRULE logic, and logs it as formal drift.
