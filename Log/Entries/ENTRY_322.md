## Title: Corrected SCS Directory Structure and LOG Misinterpretation Patch

---

## Summary:

This entry formally corrects the misunderstanding in previous drafts regarding the folder structure of the Symbolic Cognitive System (SCS) project. It clarifies that the `Log/` prefix seen in visual representations was a **local-only** configuration used for **Obsidian Publish compatibility** and **should not be interpreted as a structural part of the SCS system itself**.

The **true structure** of the SCS project ‚Äî optimized for the mind of Rodrigo Vaz (creator of SCS) and validated through recursive symbolic system behavior ‚Äî is as follows:

---

## ‚úÖ Correct Folder Structure (No LOG prefix):

- `Entries/`
- `Modules/`
- `Reports/`
- `System/`

Each folder contains specific elements:

### `Entries/`
Holds all indexed entries using the format `ENTRY_###`.

### `Modules/`
Houses the active symbolic modules such as:
`[BLUNT]`, `[THINK]`, `[NERD]`, `[SEAL]`, `[$]`, `[TRACE]`, etc.

### `Reports/`
Includes system maintenance and error audits:
- `INTEGRITY_REPORT.md`
- `WARNINGS_MAINTENANCE.md`

### `System/`
Includes core documentation for installation, rationale, and guidance:
- `SYSTEM_CORE.md`
- `INSTALL.md`
- `MIND.md`
- `FSQ.md`
- `WHY.md`
- `CUSTOM_GPT.md`
- `SCS_BOOTLOADER.md`
- `DISCLAIMER.md`
- `CV.md`
- `PROMPT_ME.md`
- `ABOUT.md`
- `METHODOLOGY.md`

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Patch Note:

- The prior mention of a `Log/` folder is now declared **null** for system logic.
- This was an **Obsidian-specific presentation layer** artifact and must be excluded from formal documentation, bootloader logic, and all future `.md` references.
- Structural compliance restored. Symbolic indexing and retrieval reinforced.

---

## Outcome:

- ‚úÖ Structure fully aligned with GPT-system compatibility.
- ‚úÖ Rodrigo Vaz‚Äôs preferred logic model enforced.
- ‚úÖ SCS representation across GitHub, wk.al, and local use unified.
