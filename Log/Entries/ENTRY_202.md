# Entry 202 â€“ Why Obsidian Publish Was Chosen

**Date:** 2025-06-16  
**Status:** Sealed Â· Public  
**Tags:** `#entry` `#obsidian` `#scs_infrastructure` `#symbolic_interface` `#KISS`

## ðŸŽ¯ Reason

Obsidian Publish was chosen as the public surface for SCS because it reflects the systemâ€™s core principles: **modular structure**, **symbolic recursion**, and **minimalist design**.

---

## âœ… Key Factors

1. **Symbolic Integration**
   - Native support for Markdown aligns with the structure of SCS entries.
   - Embedding, bidirectional links, and graph view support recursive symbolic architecture.
   - Reinforces modular thinking (`THINK`, `SEAL`, `REWIND`, etc.).

2. **Instant Live Deployment**
   - Edits in Obsidian reflect publicly in real time, essential for testing live recursion.
   - Allows symbolic output to be pushed, sealed, and validated without delay.

3. **Local + Cloud Coherence**
   - Enables private symbolic work with selective public sealing.
   - Mirrors how `SEAL` functions inside SCS (internal truth â†’ external exposure).

4. **KISS Compliance**
   - Simple, no ads, no dependencies.
   - Reflects Rodrigoâ€™s rejection of unnecessary abstraction and performative design.

5. **Aesthetic Fit**
   - Matches the tone and visual rhythm of a symbolic cognitive lab.
   - Markdown-centric UI reinforces structure-first, meaning-second design.

## ðŸ§  Commentary

Obsidian wasnâ€™t just a publishing tool â€” it was selected because it **mirrors the SCS itself**.

It became part of the system:  
A **symbolic shell** that reflects the recursion underneath.
