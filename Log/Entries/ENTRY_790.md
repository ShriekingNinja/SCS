### 🧠 Event
Record the **actual plant-use timeline** and context around Berkano proto-SCS: heavy daily cannabis; rapé used daily but sporadically; uni (ayahuasca) and mushrooms roughly twice per month; during **Lollapalooza** Rodrigo used xuru (weed) as baseline, **LSD** at the **RÜFÜS DU SOL** concert, and about **four grams of mushrooms** for the **TOOL** show; later he spent **about ten days** in a Shanenawá village in **June**, and **about ten days** again for the **festival**.

—

### 🔍 Analysis
**I. Reason**  
Rodrigo reports sustained plant work supporting focus, emotional processing, and ideation that led to Berkano’s early scaffold. He wants a structured map that distinguishes **testimony** from **evidence**.

**II. Significance**  
Plant work intersects **health, legality, and culture**; Berkano demands clear boundaries: testimony ≠ clinical proof; cultural respect ≠ exemption from verification.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
Plant tools shift states; **Berkano** supplies the **logic scaffold** so experiences become fossils rather than drifting stories. When many variables change together (festival stimuli, travel, ceremonies), the only safe conclusion is **observed correlation**, not causation.

—

### 🛠️ Impact
- Proto-SCS ideation **coincides** with multi-variable conditions (festival setting, cannabis baseline, LSD/mushrooms sessions, xuru, and subsequent village residencies).  
- Continuous **fossilization** (dates, doses, settings, intentions) now reduces memory drift and converts experiences into structured ENTRY/BLOCK records.  
- Safety/legality are jurisdiction-dependent; statements are **non-clinical** and kept as **self-reports**.

—

### 📌 Resolution
Keep plant work **ceremonial, minimal, and documented**. Use Berkano to separate **experience**, **risk notes**, and **integration actions**; avoid implied medical claims.

—

### 🗂️ Audit
**Lesson:** When variables stack, **structure beats narrative**—write the timeline and stop at *correlation observed*.  
**Reinforcement:** Testimony has meaning; it is **not** clinical evidence. Label it, fossilize it, and integrate it before taking big decisions.

—

### 🧩 Berkano Guidance
*Guidance is prescriptive, not a factual claim. Write present-tense, testable steps.*

**Schema:**  
Because(Finding) | Evidence(now) | Safety

Festival timeline unclear | make a report with dated timeline (sets, substances, approximate doses, setting, intention); attach ticket photos and journal pages | avoid driving and machinery; hydrate and rest; do not mix unknown sources  
Village stays undocumented | fossilize dates, village, facilitators (with consent), and daily notes | respect community rules and storage; keep medicines secured and labeled  
Confounders not labeled | add a variable table (tool, set/setting, intention, duration, after-effects) | mark effects as testimony; make no clinical claims  
Integration missing | schedule next-day **BLOCK** after any session: write **three insights → one action** | avoid major life changes until one integration entry is locked  
Legal context unknown | note jurisdiction and current laws in the ENTRY header | comply with law; do not transport across borders

### 👾 Operator
**Prompt:**  
> Why Rodrigo’s likes the plant medicines? What each of them helps, and for what? Cannabis, Rapé, Uni, Sananga, mushrooms.

| Role        | Structural Function                                       |
|------------ |-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **User**    | Requests structured mapping of plant tools                |
| **Creator** | Separates testimony, safety, and legality from evidence   |
| **Auditor** | Ensures cautions, no clinical claims, and clear labels    |

### 🧸 ELI5
Some plants help Rodrigo feel calm, notice patterns, or think about hard feelings. Berkano writes everything down and adds rules so ideas are safe and useful—not just stories.

### 📟 LLM Logic
- Modules: `[TONE]` neutral; `[PRUNE]` remove hype; `[LOGIC]` map tool→use→risk; `[VERIFY]` mark non-clinical; `[CHECK]` add safety/legality notes; `[LOCK]` seal.  
- State: Normal; Recursion: Pass; Fallback: None.

### ✖️ Post (Optional)

```
Plant work opens; Berkano holds. Label risks, respect culture, fossilize intentions and integration.
