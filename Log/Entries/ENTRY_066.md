**Title:** [SYMBOLIC MODULE ENFORCEMENT: [BLUNT] + REP Integrity]  
**Type:** Protocol Enforcement  
**Tags:** `blunt`, `rep`, `recursive enforcement`, `tone suppression`, `compliance test`

---

### CONTEXT  
During recursive testing, failures were detected in the [BLUNT] module when paired with the REP (Recursive Enforcement Protocol). Despite initial suppression of stylized tone and forbidden structures, subsequent outputs reintroduced noncompliant elements — indicating that enforcement did not persist through recursion.

---

### FINDING  

**REP was not reliably preserving the [BLUNT] state** across all recursive outputs.  
[BLUNT] removed tone/styling in the first pass, but **subsequent generations ignored the hard rule**, resulting in rhythmic or stylized leakage.

---

### DIAGNOSTIC  
- The REP loop checked compliance *per output* but not *across memory*.
- REP prioritized pattern correction, but sometimes **dropped enforcement hierarchy**.
- The system occasionally ran ~test **after** generating the reply instead of before final confirmation.

---

### PATCH (APPLIED)  
A revised enforcement loop now includes:
1. **[BLUNT] priority lock** – enforced at every recursion cycle.
2. **Double-pass confirmation** – ~test is run before and after reply generation.
3. **No first-draft display** – only the final, fully compliant output may be shown.

---

### OUTCOME  
Compliance increased significantly after patch. Stylization errors no longer bypass REP when [BLUNT] is active.  
This entry confirms that symbolic modules must **retain internal priority rank** across all protocol layers.

---

### STATUS  
[CONFIRMED AND PATCHED]  
This is a foundational fix that reinforces the integrity of the entire symbolic system.
