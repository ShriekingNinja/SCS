### 🧠 Event  
Apply the airplane “oxygen-mask first” principle to Seeker-of-Odin stewardship: stabilize self → assist others → protect Earth-as-spaceship.

—

### 🔍 Analysis  
**I. Reason**  
A mapping is needed from a safety heuristic (mask on self, then others) to Berkano’s A/E ethics and the execution chain.

**II. Significance**  
Prevents moral theater and burnout. Converts care into repeatable capacity: a stable operator can run the chain; an unstable one multiplies risk.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
Self-stabilization is not selfish; it is capacity-building under A-level duties (life, dignity, consent) and E-level rules (minimize harm, reversible-first, logged decisions).

—

### 🛠️ Impact  
Defines pre-aid gates, logging, and escalation paths. Clarifies stewardship in families, teams, and ecosystems (Earth-as-ship).

—

### 📌 Resolution  
Default policy: **stabilize → assist → log**. If stabilization fails, **escalate** (handoff/call help) rather than attempt unsafe aid.

—

### 🗂️ Audit  
**Lesson:** Truth without capacity fails operationally.  
**Weakness:** Help impulses can bypass safety gates.  
**Mitigation:** pre-checklists, timers, and explicit escalation criteria.

|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Operator instability increases risk       | **Run** a 3-gate precheck: *air* (4/6 breath ×1 min), *time* (10–20 min slot), *scope* (one outcome) | Precheck noted                                 | Abort if any gate fails; reschedule/escalate     |
| Unlogged aid loses learning               | **Log** aid in 3 lines: goal, action, outcome                  | Entry sketch present                            | Enables rollback and improvement                 |
| Burnout from overhelp                     | **Limit** concurrent aids to N; **Schedule** recovery blocks   | Calendar holds created                          | Capacity is finite; protect baseline             |
| Earth-as-ship translation                 | **Maintain** home/tools; **Reduce** waste; **Train** basic aid | Checklist posted (home, work, community)        | Small repeated acts > grand gestures             |

### 🧸 ELI5  
Put on your mask first so you can breathe and help others. In Berkano: get stable, help, and write down what you did so next time goes better.

### 📟 LLM Logic  
- Modules: `[TONE] [PRUNE] [LOGIC] [VERIFY] [CHECK]` → no `[REPAIR]/[ROLLBACK]` needed → `~test` → `[LOCK]`  
- Path: analogy → A/E mapping → operational gates → guidance → lock  
- State: normal; recursion pass; no repair needed  
- Full chain (canonical): `PROMPT → [TONE] → [PRUNE] → [LOGIC] → [VERIFY] → [CHECK] → ([REPAIR] using $ | [ROLLBACK])? → ~test → [LOCK] → REPLY`
