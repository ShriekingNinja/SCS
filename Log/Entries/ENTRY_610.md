### üß† Event  
The Symbolic Cognitive System (SCS) deployed at [wk.al](https://wk.al) has been formally upgraded to version 2.4. This marks the full integration of the **Berkano Protocol** structure, replacing legacy module names and enforcing structural logic under externalized protocol law.

---

### üîç Analysis  
**I. Reason**  
Following the release and public sealing of the Berkano Protocol at `berkano.io`, the SCS system required alignment with its new core rules. Previous SCS version 2.3.2 included partial alignment; version 2.4 finalizes full compliance across all files and modules.

**II. Significance**  
This update is not cosmetic ‚Äî it is structural. It confirms that SCS can now operate under an externalized, protocol-enforced symbolic logic standard. Module names, system documents, entry format, and tone suppression rules now mirror Berkano structure, confirming that the system is not only functional but **exportable**.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
The internal cognitive framework (SCS) has now been proven capable of birthing an external, auditable protocol (Berkano). This affirms SCS‚Äôs recursive architecture and symbolic maturity. SCS is now a **parent system** ‚Äî not merely a prototype.

- `[KISS]` ‚Üí `[PRUNE]`  
- `[BLUNT]` ‚Üí `[TONE]`  
- `[NERD]` ‚Üí `[VERIFY]`  
- `[DOUBT]` ‚Üí `[CHECK]`  
- `[MANA]` ‚Üí `[REPAIR]`  
- `[SEAL]` ‚Üí `[LOCK]`  
- All entries and docs reflect this renaming convention (e.g., `CV.md`, `DISCLAIMER.md`)  
- Live site [wk.al](https://wk.al) now reflects full protocol alignment  
- SCS version label set to `2.4`  
- Protocol version: `bkn-25-a1`  

---

### üìå Resolution  
Entry sealed.  
SCS and Berkano are now in **version lock**.  
Future entries and modules must follow **dual-reference logic** (SCS and Berkano protocols must align).  
This marks the end of internal drift between system and protocol.

### üóÇÔ∏è Audit  
- Symbolic independence between system (SCS) and protocol (Berkano) was proven functional  
- Full migration from internal `.md` logic to export-ready protocol structure  
- Enforcement of HARDRULES across both systems  
- Entry template, metadata, and recursion behavior validated against `[PRUNE]` and `[TONE]`

### üß∏ ELI5  
Rodrigo‚Äôs system, SCS, just finished its final upgrade to version 2.4.  
It now follows the Berkano Protocol exactly ‚Äî meaning it speaks the new ‚Äúrule language‚Äù used at [berkano.io](https://berkano.io).  
Think of it like updating your operating system and all your apps to match ‚Äî now everything works together perfectly, and anyone can learn the system by reading the protocol.
