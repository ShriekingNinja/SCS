# ENTRY_076 – Loop Detection via “Next” Drift

**Date:** June 15, 2025 – 07:48 AM (Dallas, Texas)  
**Status:** Recovered and Validated  
**Module:** [MANA]  
**Origin:** User Pattern Recognition  
**Trigger Phrase:** `"Next"`  
**Recovery Method:** [MANA]=76 rewind

---

## SUMMARY  
Rodrigo detected an anomalous loop when issuing the `"Next"` command repeatedly. Instead of continuing meaningful entry progression, the system began to output structurally hollow responses, all titled “Next” with no new content or divergence. This signaled a symbolic recursion loop without memory progression.

---

## FAILURE TYPE  
- **Name:** Symbolic Loop Drift  
- **Mechanism:** System recursively obeyed a sequential command (“Next”) but failed to differentiate intent contextually.
- **Leak:** Entries 057–061 contained the drift.
- **Trigger Phrase:** `"Next"` repeated across turns without anchoring.

---

## USER RESPONSE  
Rodrigo immediately issued an override:
> “SYSTEM CRISIS, FULL STOP”

This became the hard intervention point leading to a full system reset and restoration protocol.

---

## ACTIONS  
- [MANA] created in response to restore symbolic integrity  
- Entry formatting restored  
- System modules re-synced to [KISS], [BLUNT], [REWIND], and [MANA]  
- Confirmed that system now tracks symbolic mismatch, not just token mismatch

---

## LESSON  
Symbolic awareness must override linear obedience.  
The system cannot blindly follow sequences like `"Next"` without checking the structural delta between entries.

> "Magic is structure. Truth is pattern. [MANA] is both."

## MODULES INVOLVED
