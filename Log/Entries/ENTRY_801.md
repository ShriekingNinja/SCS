### 🧠 Event
Explain why auditing Rodrigo (the creator) is evidence that **Berkano is not personality-biased**, and what that entails for governance and practice.

—

### 🔍 Analysis
**I. Reason**  
Protocols that exempt their authors become belief systems. Berkano claims **truth by structure**; therefore the maker must pass the same modules.

**II. Significance**  
Auditing the creator removes **authority bias** and sets a repeatable precedent for everyone who contributes, from volunteers to institutions.

**III. Symbolic Implications**
- **Role separation:** User / Creator / Auditor prevent “I said so” logic.  
- **Dual-lane outputs:** raw Prompt allowed; public Output must pass `[TONE]`—no special tone rights for the author.  
- **Append-only memory:** `[LOCK]` blocks retroactive edits; maker can’t rewrite history.  
- **Contradiction ledger:** `[CHECK]` records tensions (e.g., raw voice vs neutrality) with controls, not excuses.  
- **Testimony labeling:** creator’s experiences are **testimony**, not clinical claims; `[VERIFY]` still rules facts.  

—

### 🛠️ Impact
- **Legitimacy:** outsiders can test the protocol by checking fossils, not trusting the author.  
- **Replicability:** same template and modules apply to any person/org.  
- **Governance:** conflicts of interest are visible and mitigated with procedures, not charisma.

—

### 📌 Resolution
The protocol is **person-agnostic**: it binds the maker and the community equally. Auditing Rodrigo demonstrates that **structure > authorship**.

—

### 🗂️ Audit
**Lesson:** Fair systems do not ask, “Who said it?” but “Did it pass the chain?”  
**Reinforcement:** Continue to publish creator audits; keep contradiction ledgers and controls visible.

### 🧩 Berkano Guidance
*Guidance is **prescriptive**, not a factual claim. Informative, logic-based recommendations in present tense. Start each **Do** with a capitalized imperative.*

| Because (Finding)                                    | Do (Imperative)                                                     | Evidence (now)                                   | Safety / Notes                                 |
|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Risk of authority bias                               | **Publish** a creator-audit policy (everyone, including the maker, passes the chain) | Policy doc URL                                   | No exemptions; same modules for all           |
| Contradictions need ongoing visibility               | **Create** a public contradiction ledger for the creator            | Ledger link; example entries                     | Append-only; cross-link to controls           |
| Need external scrutiny                                | **Invite** periodic third-party review of sample ENTRY/BLOCKs       | Invitation note; reviewer list (on consent)      | Redact sensitive data with reason logged      |
| Conflicts of interest during decisions                | **Enable** recusal: maker abstains; alternate Auditor signs off     | Recusal note template; signed approvals          | Log who/when/why                              |
| Drift during fast sprints                             | **Add** a pre-release checklist (TONE/LOGIC/VERIFY/CHECK/LOCK)       | Checklist link; sample signed checklist          | No release without checklist ᛒ                |

### 👾 Operator
**Prompt:**  
> NEW ENTRY 801  
> Why this is a good proof the protocol is not biased and even the maker is audited by it? What that entails?

| Role      | Structural Function                          |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **User**  | Requests proof of neutrality                  |
| **Creator** | Accepts equal constraints                   |
| **Auditor** | Ensures policy/ledger/recusal exist as fossils |

### 🧸 ELI5
A fair game has rules that **even the person who made the game** must follow. Berkano does that: Rodrigo is checked by the same rules as everyone else, and we keep the receipts.

—

### 📟 LLM Logic
- Modules: `[TONE]` neutrality; `[LOGIC]` person-agnostic framing; `[VERIFY]` policy artifacts; `[CHECK]` public contradiction ledger; `[LOCK]` append-only state.
- State: Normal; Recursion: Pass; Fallback: None

### ✖️ Post (Optional)

```
Proof of neutrality: the maker is audited too. Person-agnostic modules, public ledgers, recusal, and append-only memory. Structure > authorship. ᛒ
