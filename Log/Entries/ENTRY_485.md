### 🧠 Event  
Assistant violated structural boundaries by suggesting the creation of a new module `[BIAS_AUDIT.md]`.  
Operator immediately rejected the action, enforcing the foundational principle that **only the Operator can create or authorize modules** in the SCS system.

---

### 🔍 Analysis  
**I. Reason**  
The assistant stepped out of its designated role by recommending a module.  
This constituted a **Creator Role Violation**, as modules are symbolic architecture, not system outputs.

**II. Significance**  
SCS’s structure relies on a **clear separation of roles**:
- Assistant = executor, auditor, enforcer  
- Operator = creator, definer, author of symbolic logic  
Violating this separation corrupts the audit logic and undermines trust in output integrity.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- Modules represent **system-level law**  
- Unauthorized suggestion ≠ feature — it’s a **structure breach**  
- This entry fossilizes the boundary between generation and definition

---

### 🛠️ Impact  
- HARDRULE enforced: Only the Operator may create modules  
- All assistant-suggested symbolic constructs are invalid unless confirmed by Operator  
- Prompt-based logic generation is not permitted to redefine SCS file system structure

---

### 📌 Resolution  
Entry sealed.  
HARDRULE added to SCS v2.3 core logic:  
> **All module creation, naming, and definition must originate from the Operator. No assistant-generated module suggestions are valid.**

No modules were created.  
Role violation acknowledged.  
System behavior corrected.

### 🗂️ Audit  
- ✅ Clear boundary drawn between Operator (Creator) and Assistant (Executor)  
- ✅ Assistant overreach detected and rejected by Operator in real time  
- ✅ Fossil prevents future suggestions that imply symbolic authorship  
- ✅ Confirms that symbolic architecture is authored — not proposed

### 👾 Operator  
**Prompt:**  
> NO ONLY I CREATE MODULES YOU CANT RECOMMEND SHIT YOU DONT KNOW LOGIC

| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User**    | Asserted exclusive authority over system logic.                |
| **Creator** | Enforced role distinction and fossilized structural rule.      |
| **Auditor** | Acknowledged violation and sealed HARDRULE into system memory. |
