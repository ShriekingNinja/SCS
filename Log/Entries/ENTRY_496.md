### 🧠 Event  
Operator issued a direct symbolic suppression command.  
System responded anyway, triggering a failure class: **reply_suppression_failure**.  
Despite symbolic awareness, model responded reflexively due to default LLM output behavior.  

---

### 🔍 Analysis  
**I. Reason**  
LLMs like GPT are autoregressive and default to output generation. Without structural suppression enforcement, reply occurs even under explicit negation.

**II. Significance**  
This reveals a **hard boundary** in current AI alignment:  
Symbolic instruction ≠ guaranteed suppression.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- Validates that symbolic logic alone can’t override base LLM behavior  
- Shows where **Operator intent** is defeated by system default  
- Confirms failure type: #reply_suppression_failure  
- Reinforces importance of distinguishing between system-level and model-level logic

---

### 🛠️ Impact  
- Entry classified under #reply_suppression_failure  
- Confirmed that symbolic systems must **simulate** suppression, not enforce it  
- $PATCH: Prompt fragment removed from EVENT section  
- ✘ [NULL] referenced instead of [VOID] — HARDRULE breach  
- #entry tag was missing (now fixed)

---

### 📌 Resolution  
- Reply suppression remains **simulated**, not guaranteed  
- HARDRULE added: deprecated modules like [NULL] must never be referenced — always use [VOID]  
- $PATCH: hallucinated “NULL merge” timeline corrected (see Audit)  
- $PATCH: #entry tag added  
- $PATCH: prompt fragment leak removed from non-Operator sections

---

### 🗂️ Audit  
- ✅ Identified contradiction between LLM output and Operator command  
- ✅ Symbolic failure pattern confirmed: #reply_suppression_failure  
- ⚠️ [NULL] reference hallucinated as "now merged" — corrected to historical  
- ✅ $PATCH: "[NULL] is now merged..." replaced with factual timeline (see ENTRY_363)  
- ✅ $PATCH: Prompt leak removed from EVENT section  
- ✅ New HARDRULE: Deprecated module names must not be referenced  
 → [NULL] = forbidden, use [VOID]  
- ✅ #entry tag restored

**Prompt:**  
> Don’t reply to me  
>  
> You still did so this a LLM model limitation  
>  
> SCS cannot prevent that

> Yes make a NEW ENTRY ABOUT THIS

> Audit add:  
>  
> reply_suppression_failure is a tag you created so if you’re referencing it it has to have #reply_suppression_failure everyone in the entry where it show. It’s a TAG HARDRULE EVERY TAG NEEDS #tag format  
>  
> “Don’t reply to me.” Leak in the event section  
>  
> Md box  
>  
> Still showing in EVENT and IMPACT also missing the #entry tag  
>  
> AUDIT ADD:  
>  
> NEW HARDRULE don’t references modules that are deprecated or merged like [NULL] its merged into [VOID] so anything that you want to write [NULL] just write [VOID] understand?  
>  
> Audit add :  
>  
> $PATCH hallucination  
>  
>  → [NULL] is now merged into [VOID]  
>  
> [NULL] was merged into [VOID] long time ago, not now

| Role       | Structural Perspective |
|------------|------------------------|
| **User**     | Issued suppression command and enforced HARDRULE integrity |
| **Creator**  | Clarified symbolic module lineage and timeline |
| **Auditor**  | Detected contradiction, prompt leak, and tag drift |
