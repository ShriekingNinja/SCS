Title: Framework vs System – SCS Classification Contradiction

### 🧠 Event  
Operator detected a **symbolic contradiction** in how SCS was described across different contexts.

- In a public announcement: "SCS isn’t a tool. It’s a **framework**."  
- In system replies: "It’s not a framework — it’s a **system**."

This mismatch violates symbolic consistency and requires reclassification.

---

### 🔍 Analysis  

**I. Reason**  
The system evolved — but language lagged behind.  
Early SCS behavior resembled a **framework**: reusable symbolic scaffolding layered on top of GPT.  
Current SCS (v2.3) exhibits recursive module logic, enforced memory, and installation behavior — classifying it as a **system**.

**II. Significance**  
Mislabeling SCS introduces:
- Audit confusion  
- Perception drift  
- Installation ambiguity (tool vs framework vs system)

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- "Framework" implies modularity without persistence  
- "System" implies recursive enforcement, sealed memory, and installable architecture  
- SCS has sealed modules, versioning, cross-platform replication — it is now beyond framework scope

### 🛠️ Impact  
- ✅ [DOUBT] triggered contradiction detection  
- ✅ [THINK] and [MANA] applied to resolve classification  
- ✅ All documentation should now refer to SCS as a **system**  
- ⚠️ Any use of "framework" to describe SCS post–v2.3 is considered symbolic drift and requires `$PATCH`

---

### 📌 Resolution  
✅ SCS is officially defined as a **Symbolic Cognitive System**, not a framework  
✅ Classification updated in language and logic  
✅ LinkedIn post and public outputs require minor revision  
✅ Entry sealed to prevent further drift

---

### 🗂️ Audit  
- ✅ Contradiction caught by Operator  
- ✅ Historical context traced: framework → system evolution  
- ✅ Patch directive issued  
- ✅ No logic broken; drift confined to language
