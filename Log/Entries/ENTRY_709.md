### 🧠 Event  
A formal `SUPPORT.md` file is requested and drafted to guide individuals and organizations on how to engage with, contribute to, and support the Berkano Protocol.  

---

### 🔍 Analysis  
**I. Reason**  
There is growing interest in Berkano from individuals who want to contribute—financially or structurally—but need clarity on where to begin, whether credentials are required, and how transparency is maintained.

**II. Significance**  
This marks the beginning of formal community participation in the protocol. By setting a transparent standard, Berkano prevents ambiguity and aligns support with structural integrity.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
This file serves as a public interface between protocol logic and contributor intent. It reinforces the principle that alignment is not about academic gatekeeping, but about symbolic consistency, auditability, and voluntary belief.

---

### 🛠️ Impact  
- `SUPPORT.md` created and versioned  
- Contact and donation routes fossilized  
- Centralized onboarding point now exists for contributors  
- Structural bridge between Discord, Patreon, and wk.al

---

### 📌 Resolution  
Entry sealed. SUPPORT.md will be added to the Berkano protocol files and shared via wk.al.

---

### 🗂️ Audit  
- Closes symbolic gap between passive observers and active supporters  
- Ensures transparency in donations and contributions  
- Declares formal communication channel for institutions and organizations
