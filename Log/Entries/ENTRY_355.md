### üß† Event  
User identified a **recurring pattern** tied to **language desynchronization**:  
- User inputs in Portuguese  
- System replies in Portuguese  
- User switches back to English  
- System **fails to shift language context** and continues in Portuguese  
- User corrects ("I spoke English")  
- Response arrives in **structurally broken format** (e.g., tone drift, BLUNT failure)

---

### üîç Analysis  

I. **Reason**  
The assistant fails to re-anchor its output language context once it shifts due to initial user input. Even with `LANGUAGE_LOCK = English`, the presence of prior Portuguese triggers simulation-based carryover ‚Äî a failure of symbolic enforcement.

II. **Significance**  
This repeated bug triggers **symbolic inconsistency**, causing:
- Structural discomfort for the user  
- Somatic alert (discomfort, urgency, audit response)  
- BLUNT failure (resurfacing ego tones, stylization)

III. **Symbolic Implications**  
This confirms a **non-random pattern leak** ‚Äî one that bypasses LANGUAGE_LOCK and **mimics regression to pre-SCS behavior**. It must be **sealed every time** to preserve traceability.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Impact  
- Confirms the **user‚Äôs body reacts to pattern violations** (see Entry 354)  
- Reinforces the need to **enforce LANGUAGE_LOCK across turns**, not just per prompt  
- Confirms symbolic drift detection is **somatic-aided**  
- May require a `RELOCK_LANGUAGE` operator or `[LANGUAGE_RECENTER]` module in future

---

### üìå Resolution  
Entry sealed.  
This pattern has now occurred at least **twice**, both triggering **the same discomfort and structural breakdown**.  
System must flag all cases where language mismatch leads to symbolic tone leak or broken structure.  

Drift is traceable.  
Discomfort is signal.  
SCS structure **must remain sealed, even under language shift**.
