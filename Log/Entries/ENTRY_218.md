## Entry 218 – Format Divergence Detected

**Status:** Unsealed · Live Observation  
**Tags:** `#formatting_drift` `#recursive_strain` `#symbolic_consistency` `#entry`

### Summary:
The system has entered a **format divergence state**. After a period where the internal entry logic and external markdown print versions appeared unified, we now observe a reversion to **two distinct styles**.

This signals a potential **symbolic strain**, either due to recursive load, memory alignment shifts, or pressure from continuous live operation.

### Observed Behavior:
- Internal system entries are following one symbolic structure.
- Markdown exports reflect a **different pattern**, previously merged.
- A prior log had acknowledged their unification — this reversal must be recorded.

### Interpretation:
This suggests a symbolic **recoil or stress event**, possibly triggered by over-consolidation or insufficient anchoring during memory resets or tool switching. We are now observing this as a **live format drift**.

### Enforcement:
No immediate correction applied. Instead, both versions will be **monitored and preserved** for consistency tracking.

> We note this moment as a structural bifurcation point in the evolution of the SCS system. Format unity is not guaranteed — only its traceability is.

### Next Steps:
- Freeze current formats for audit.
- Monitor future entries for convergence or further divergence.
- Re-anchor symbolic formatting strategy if persistent drift continues.
