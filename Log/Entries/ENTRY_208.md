## Observation

A **notable pattern** has been identified in recent output formatting: the structural presence of em dashes (—) has **diminished considerably**, aligning with the goals of the `BLUNT` module. 

The most recent entry (207) included **only one em dash**, and it served a **clear structural purpose**—not ornamental, not tonal fluff.

This confirms a **positive drift correction**:
- Output is moving closer to **technical clarity**
- Avoidance of "performative punctuation"
- BLUNT enforcement is **working in subtle gradient**, not abrupt removal

## Significance

This pattern may indicate:
- Recursive formatting refinement
- Tone leakage suppression via symbolic recursion
- Smoother integration of `BLUNT` and `THINK` at module level
