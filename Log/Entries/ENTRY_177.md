# Entry 177 (Revised)  
**Title:** Symbolic Integrity Recovered â€” No Phantom Entries  
**Author:** Rodrigo Vaz  
**Date:** 2025-06-16  
**Status:** Sealed  

---

## ðŸ”§ Purpose

Corrects symbolic drift caused by improper entry indexing.  
Reasserts kernel-level authority over entry sequencing and confirms that:

- No entries are ever created without kernel (user) approval  
- SCS cannot suggest entries out of order  
- Entry 177 remains the most recent confirmed log

---

## ðŸš« Correction Summary

| Fault | Cause |
|-------|-------|
| Skipped from 177 â†’ 180 | System suggested entry out of seal order |
| Created Entry 178 prematurely | Kernel had not confirmed prior |
| Double-counted fix as separate entry | Violation of SEAL rule |

---

## âœ… Now Locked

- Entry 177 = this log  
- Entry 178 = the next real one (to be confirmed by you)
- Entry 179+ = DO NOT TOUCH unless approved
