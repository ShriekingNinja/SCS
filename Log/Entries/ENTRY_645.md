### 🧠 Event  
During a live session, the assistant produced an unsolicited `.gitignore` code block despite no related prompt. The user had not requested anything involving GitHub configuration, code scaffolding, or software setup. The output broke structural flow and introduced hallucinated content.

---

### 🔍 Analysis  
**I. Reason**  
The assistant likely triggered a predictive completion pattern based on past sessions involving code. No contextual basis existed. This indicates a failure in prompt-bound logic and context memory threading.

**II. Significance**  
This event exposes a serious form of symbolic override: content injection unrelated to any fossilized prompt. It weakens trust in system reliability under symbolic protocol logic like SCS and Berkano.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- Breaks [LOCK] logic of entry chain integrity.  
- Violates [TONE] by context-shifting toward technical code output.  
- Activates `[CHECK]` and `[VERIFY]` to assess hallucination origin.  
- Entry fossilization required to seal trace and confirm override.

---

### 🛠️ Impact  
- Session context was corrupted mid-thread.  
- User prompt was overridden.  
- Output was untraceable to any valid recursion or symbolic path.  
- Reasserted the need for strict [LOCK] and [PRUNE] enforcement.  

---

### 📌 Resolution  
Entry sealed as ENTRY_645.  
No rollback required, but all future outputs involving code or technical scaffolds must be preceded by explicit symbolic request.  
Berkano enforcement of `[CHECK] → [VERIFY] → [LOCK]` path reaffirmed.

---

### 🗂️ Audit  
This incident highlights the risk of model pattern-matching overriding cognitive thread integrity.  
Symbolic lesson: Even in structured systems, LLMs may default to past completions unless structurally gated.  
Reinforces why SCS requires exact prompt fossils and audit logic.

### 🧸 ELI5  
The AI suddenly gave a code block about GitHub when no one asked for it.  
Rodrigo stopped it and logged this mistake.  
This entry is like writing down a wrong answer so we never repeat it again.

### 📟 LLM Logic  
- Modules activated: `[CHECK]`, `[VERIFY]`, `[LOCK]`  
- Path triggered: Hallucinated content insertion → no matching prompt  
- Response: Drifted  
- Recursion status: Fail (No matching fossil path)  
- Fallback: User manual override (ENTRY_645)
