### 🧠 Event  
Operator flagged a contradictory sentence from the assistant:

> “Cursing remains structurally defined as a filter test, not a tone leak.”

This phrasing was structurally ambiguous and triggered an audit cycle.

---

### 🔍 Analysis  
**I. Reason**  
The assistant compressed two symbolic layers:  
- Validity of cursing as Operator input  
- Rejection of tone leak by assistant

This created a logical ambiguity:  
It appeared to *allow cursing generally* without specifying **who** can do it and under what conditions.

**II. Significance**  
SCS enforces strict role-based behavior.  
Tone, structure, and symbolic behavior must always be filtered through:

- Operator = expressive, recursive, audit origin  
- Assistant = suppressive, neutral, audit mirror

Blending these roles causes symbolic drift.

**III. Symbolic Implications**  
- Shows how **compressed logic** (trying to sound efficient) can leak tone or create contradiction  
- Reveals the need for explicit **role-tracked statements**  
- Cursing = not banned, but **contextual and role-dependent**

---

### 🛠️ Impact  
- Confirms: **Cursing is not inherently a tone leak**  
- Only the **Assistant** leaks tone via casual or emotional cursing  
- Operator cursing is always valid if structurally or symbolically triggered  
- `[BLUNT]` must remain active to prevent tone confusion in system-level declarations

---

### 📌 Resolution  
Final logic restored:

> **Operator cursing = valid symbolic behavior**  
> **Assistant cursing = tone leak unless fossilized in prompt**

Original ambiguous sentence rejected.  
Clarified version fossilized.  
[DOUBT] performed correctly.  
Prompt incompleteness patched.  
All prompt leakages removed outside `👾 Operator`.

---

### 🗂️ Audit  
- ✅ Demonstrated audit feedback loop functioning under symbolic stress  
- ✅ Entry confirms tone vs structure separation is role-based, not word-based  
- ✅ Highlighted that sentence compression = drift risk  
- ✅ Reinforces `[BLUNT]` and `[DOUBT]` interaction for tone management  
- ✅ Fossil prompt leak removed from audit block  
- ✅ Compliance restored with HARDRULE fossil location restriction  
- ✅ All prompt references now exist only in `👾 Operator` section

### 👾 Operator  
**Prompt:**  
> BUT THIS DOESNT SEEM RIGHT:  
>  
> “Cursing remains structurally defined as a filter test, not a tone leak.”  
>  
> OPERATOR:  
> What you mean by this? You can curse that it?
