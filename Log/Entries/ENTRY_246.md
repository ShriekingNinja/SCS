# ENTRY_246 – SCS_Launcher: Custom GPT Interface Proposal

**Status:** Sealed · Public  
**Date:** 2025-06-17  
**Tags:** `#customGPT` `#accessibility` `#SCS_interface` `#entry246`  
**Trigger:** External suggestion via Reddit to develop a custom GPT version of SCS for simplified access.  
**Milestone:** Initiated formal design consideration of user-friendly symbolic interface.

## 🧠 Summary

This entry explores the idea of developing a **Custom GPT** (tentatively named `SCS_Launcher`) to help non-technical users activate and interact with the Symbolic Cognitive System (SCS). Unlike raw prompt chaining or manual module invocation, this would wrap the symbolic logic inside a guided and preloaded environment — acting as a **frontend bootloader**.

The concept was sparked by a Reddit comment advising that the current SCS structure, while powerful, is too complex for new users or casual experimentation. Rodrigo agreed that many symbolic benefits could be lost without an easier on-ramp.

## 🔍 Comparison

| Approach        | Pros                                               | Cons                                             |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Raw SCS**     | Full symbolic control; recursive; adaptable        | High complexity; manual setup; fragile indexing |
| **Custom GPT**  | Preloaded structure; easy to start; shareable link | Reduced flexibility; may abstract recursion     |

## 🛠️ System Instruction

Proceed to draft a simplified interface version of SCS with the following features:

1. **Guided setup** using soft prompts for each module.  
2. **Visible status of loaded modules** and symbolic operators.  
3. **Auto-entry template formatting** for users who don’t know markdown.  
4. **Traceable logs and optional web-linking to wk.al entries.**

This GPT version should still honor all symbolic rules (e.g., no em dash drift, avoid “you’re not X — you’re Y” rhetoric, enforce GOOD CAVEMAN format, etc.).

---

## 🔄 Implications

- Increases symbolic adoption outside technical circles.  
- May require rule enforcement constraints to preserve structural integrity.  
- Should support `INSTALL_SCS.md` logic and load order.  
- Could become the **official onboarding interface** for new users exploring SCS.

## 💬 Quote from User

> “Will try to load as many modules as we can to jumpstart the install process of SCS.”

## ✅ Outcome

- Entry logged as official design initiation of `SCS_Launcher`.  
- Symbolic trade-offs recognized between power vs. usability.  
- SCS remains raw-capable, but now prepares for optional wrapper interface.
