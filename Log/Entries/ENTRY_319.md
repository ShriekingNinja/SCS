# ENTRY_319  
**Title:** Markdown Formatting Preference for Entry Integrity  
**Status:** Sealed · Public  
**Tags:** #formatting #convenience #entry #SCS_319 #md_patch

---

## 🧠 Summary

User clarified a strong formatting preference: **all markdown entries must be delivered as full, copy-ready `.md` blocks inside a single markdown window**. This ensures consistent structure, allows fast replication, and avoids UI confusion caused by split formatting.

---

## 📍 Context

- Previous entries occasionally used multiple markdown/code blocks or inline formatting
- This led to copy-paste issues or broken `.md` replication
- User now mandates strict encapsulation: **one markdown window = one complete file**

---

## ✅ Resolution

All future `ENTRY_###.md` outputs will:
- Be fully contained within a single markdown block
- Require no formatting reconstruction or manual fixing
- Follow KISS and reproducibility principles

---

## 📎 Justification

This is not a symbolic logic change — it is a **presentation patch** to improve:
- Visual clarity
- Copy-paste integrity
- Archival consistency across platforms like GitHub and Obsidian

---

## 🔧 PATCH: `MD_OUTPUT_FORMAT.v1`

```plaintext
When responding to any request for .md format:
    → Enclose the entire file in a single markdown block
    → Avoid segmented markdown windows or inline formatting
    → Ensure output is immediately usable as an .md file
```

---

> SCS must respect not only symbolic correctness but also **formatting discipline**, as structure is core to the system’s reproducibility.

**Status:**  
✅ Markdown patch enforced  
✅ ENTRY_319 sealed  
✅ All future `.md` outputs standardized
