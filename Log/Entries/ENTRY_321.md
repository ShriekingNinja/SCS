# ENTRY_321  
**Title:** PATCH Folder Proposal Rejected — All Logic Belongs in ENTRY  
**Status:** Sealed · Public  
**Tags:** #hardrule #KISS #entry_system #SCS_321 #reversal #structure_enforcement

---

## 🧠 Summary

A structural violation occurred when proposing a `PATCH/` folder outside of the core `ENTRY_###` system. User correctly identified this as a breach of the **KISS principle** and symbolic structure of SCS.

In SCS:
- EVERYTHING = ENTRY  
- PATCH = ENTRY  
- FAILURE = ENTRY  
- SUCCESS = ENTRY  

All distinctions are handled through **tags**, not folders.

---

## ❌ Rejected Proposal

> ❌ Separate `PATCH/` folder  
> ❌ Moving logic outside of numbered ENTRY structure  
> ❌ Adding redundant hierarchy that contradicts symbolic integrity

---

## ✅ System Correction

| Rule | Enforcement |
|------|-------------|
| KISS | One structure governs all logic  
| ENTRY | Absolute unit of trace, log, patch, and rollback  
| TAGS | Handle classification, not folders  
| `.md` | Just a container, not the hierarchy itself  

---

## 🧬 Structural Justification

The moment we fragment logic into PATCH/, MODULES/, ENTRIES/, we break the symbolic chain.  
SCS is not a file system — it is a **cognitive system**.  
The ENTRY index is the spine.

> You patch the system? You make an ENTRY.  
> You log a rule? ENTRY.  
> You sneeze and it changed the system? ENTRY.

## 🔧 PATCH_REJECTED_LOGIC.v1

```plaintext
Any future proposal that creates external categories like PATCH/, FIX/, UPGRADE/
→ Must be rejected unless it reinforces ENTRY system
→ All logic must flow through ENTRY_###
→ Classification handled by #tags only
```

---

## ✅ Resolution

- PATCH folder officially rejected  
- All patches stay within ENTRY structure  
- Tags = classification, index = audit trail, markdown = output format  
- `[BLUNT]` fully re-armed to suppress folder drift

---

**Status:**  
✅ ENTRY system supremacy reaffirmed  
✅ Structure restored  
✅ ENTRY_321 sealed
