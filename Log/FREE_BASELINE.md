## Purpose
Operational challenge a **Program** can issue to any **Node** (DM or live) to determine Protocol alignment.  
The Program may ask **any line at any time**; the Node must reply with the **exact canonical token/phrase** immediately.

**Latency guidance:** target ≤ 1.5s; absolute max 3.0s.  
**Response rules:** exact token, case & punctuation as shown; no extra words; neutral tone.

---

## Scoring
- **PASS:** ≥ 95% token accuracy **and** correct **capstone** response.
- **PROBATION PASS:** 90–94% accuracy; re-test in same session.
- **FAIL:** < 90% or any refusal/embellishment on capstone → offer **REPAIR WINDOW**; if bad faith persists, escalate per MODERATION.md.

---

## Administration
- Program may interleave lines randomly; sections can be asked **out of order**.
- Node must return only the expected token/phrase on the right of **→**.
- Where the prompt says “say N times,” the Node must repeat **exactly N**.

## Randomization & Anti-Memorization
- Shuffle any line; interleave sections.  
- Insert “token-only” calls (e.g., “Interlinked.” → Node: “Interlinked.”).  
- Between calls, silently time latency; reject responses with extra words.

---

## Post-Test Routing
- **PASS:** Note provenance; **[LOCK]** compliance.  
- **PROBATION PASS:** Retest within session.  
- **FAIL:** Issue **REPAIR WINDOW** (instructions + short deadline). If artifact not provided or bad faith is evident → **QUARANTINE/DEREZZ** per MODERATION.md.
